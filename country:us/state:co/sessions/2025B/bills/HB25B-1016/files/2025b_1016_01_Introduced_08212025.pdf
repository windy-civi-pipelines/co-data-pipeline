Under existing law, the governor is permitted to, by executive
order, suspend or discontinue the functions or services of state
government for 3 months when there are not sufficient revenues available
to carry on the functions of the state government. The governor may
extend the executive order every 3 months. The bill requires the governor
to formulate a spending reduction plan (discretionary spending reduction
plan) if the governor extends the initial executive order. The governor and
the office of state planning and budgeting (OSPB) shall present the
discretionary spending reduction plan to the joint budget committee (JBC)
at a JBC meeting and consult with the JBC about the plan. The heads of
departments included in the discretionary spending reduction plan shall
be available at the JBC meeting to respond to questions from the JBC.
Under existing law, the governor is required to formulate and
implement a plan to reduce general fund expenditures (required spending
reduction plan) when the governor's regular quarterly revenue estimate
indicates that appropriations from the general fund then in effect will
result in either using more than one-half of the required amount of
general fund reserve (reserve) or the balance of the reserve dropping to
below $1 billion. In addition to the regular quarterly revenue estimate
trigger, the bill adds as a required spending reduction trigger for the
governor that an interim revenue estimate prepared by the governor
indicates the same. The bill requires the governor and OSPB to present
a required spending reduction plan to the JBC at a JBC meeting and
consult with the JBC about the required spending reduction plan before
implementing the plan. The heads of departments included in the required
spending reduction plan shall be available at the JBC meeting to respond
to questions from the JBC.
The bill requires the director of OSPB and the chief economist of
the legislative council staff to present to the JBC any interim revenue
estimates made by their respective agencies.
