Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) In 2024, the general assembly enacted Senate Bill 24-205, which created consumer protections in interactions with artificial intelligence systems (provisions). The provisions include a definition of "consequential decision", which definition determines the types of artificial intelligence systems that are considered high-risk artificial intelligence systems for the purpose of the provisions and, therefore, regulated under current law. The bill narrows the definition of "consequential decision" to only include decisions related to employment or public safety. The bill also: Changes the effective date of the provisions from February 1, 2026, to August 1, 2027; Exempts businesses with fewer than 250 employees from the provisions; Exempts businesses with less than $5 million in annual revenue from the provisions; and Exempts local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents from the provisions. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, 6-1-1701, amend (3); repeal (8); and add (10.5) as follows: Page 2, Line 36-1-1701.Â Â Definitions.
