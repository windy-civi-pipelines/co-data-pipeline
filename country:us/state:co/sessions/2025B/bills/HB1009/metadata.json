The bill narrows the definition of \"consequential decision\" to only include decisions related to employment or public safety.The bill also:Changes the effective date of the provisions from February 1, 2026, to August 1, 2027;Exempts businesses with fewer than 250 employees from the provisions;Exempts businesses with less than $5 million in annual revenue from the provisions; andExempts local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents from the provisions.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"
