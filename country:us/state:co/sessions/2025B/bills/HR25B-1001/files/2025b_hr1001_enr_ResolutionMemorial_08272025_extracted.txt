CONCERNING THE CONDEMNATION OF THE CONDUCT OF
FORMER REPRESENTATIVE RYAN ARMAGOST.
WHEREAS, On April 11, 2025, former Representative Ryan
Armagost, then serving as Minority Whip and Chair of the House
Workplace Harassment Committee, which is the body charged with
investigating workplace harassment complaints, took a photograph of a
colleague, without her knowledge, while she stood in the well of the
House chamber to debate her bill, and former Representative Ryan
Armagost immediately shared that photograph in a Republican caucus
group chat with comments that were subsequently deleted, prompting
degrading and sexualizing remarks from multiple legislators who
compared their colleague to a prostitute and stripper, made jokes about
the "oldest profession", and further mocked her appearance; and
WHEREAS, That photograph was subsequently disseminated on
social media by anonymous accounts, accompanied by vulgar
commentary, and comments on the social media posts quickly escalated
into racist and misogynistic attacks, rape threats, and violent threats
directed against the colleague and her young children; and
WHEREAS, Former Representative Ryan Armagost's conduct was a
violation of the General Assembly's Workplace Expectations Policy,
which applied to him as a member, a member who was a leader of his
caucus and the Chair of the House Workplace Harassment Committee, a
position charged with upholding the very standards of safety and respect
that his actions undermined; and
WHEREAS, Former Representative Ryan Armagost announced his
resignation on August 21, 2025, shortly after news of a resolution to
censure him became public, and his resignation does not erase the harm
caused; and
WHEREAS, The House of Representatives declares that former
Representative Ryan Armagost behaved inappropriately and failed to
uphold the honor, dignity, and respect of the House of Representatives,
which reflects poorly upon the state of Colorado and its citizens; and
WHEREAS, The House of Representatives finds that such conduct
can create an unsafe and hostile workplace and can have a chilling effect
on women serving in elected office; and
WHEREAS, The House of Representatives finds that former
Representative Ryan Armagost failed to uphold decorum of the House of
Representatives, and his actions were unbecoming of a member of this
body; now, therefore,
Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-fifth
General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
(1) That the House of Representatives condemns the actions of
former Representative Ryan Armagost as conduct incompatible with the
dignity of this body; and
(2) That the House of Representatives affirms its ongoing
responsibility to provide a safe, respectful, and professional workplace for
all members, staff, and visitors and declares that harassment and
misogyny will never be tolerated in this body; and
(3) That every member of the House of Representatives commits to
treating colleagues with dignity and respect, ensuring that disagreements
remain rooted in policy and debate rather than in personal attacks,
harassment, or demeaning conduct.
PAGE 2-HOUSE RESOLUTION 25B-1001
Be It Further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of
Representatives print this Resolution in its entirety in the House Journal.
