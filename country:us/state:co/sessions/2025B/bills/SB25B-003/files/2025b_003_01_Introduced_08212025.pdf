healthy school meals for all program (program) that the secretary of state
will submit to the voters at the November 2025 statewide election. The
amended ballot title language allows the additional tax revenue
authorized by the ballot issue to be spent on supporting access to healthy
food for Colorado kids and families and not just on the program.
Section 3 amends the healthy school meals for all cash fund
(fund), as the fund would exist upon voters approving the ballot issue
concerning increasing taxes annually by $95 million to support the
program that the secretary of state will submit to the voters at the
November 2025 statewide election. Section 3 expands the permissible
uses of money in the fund. Section 3 allows money in the fund to be used
for, among other things, supporting the implementation of the
supplemental nutritional assistance program, so long as the program is
fully funded first.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) In July 2025, the United States Congress passed, and the
5 president signed into law, a federal budget bill, Pub.L. 119-21, that
6 significantly reduced funding for the supplemental nutritional assistance
7 program and shifted new and ongoing financial responsibilities to the
8 states;
9 (b) These federal changes are projected to, starting in state fiscal
10 year 2026-27, impose at least $50 million in new annual costs to the state
11 of Colorado to administer the supplemental nutritional assistance program
12 and, in future years, potentially impose additional costs to the state of
13 Colorado to provide a portion of the supplemental nutritional assistance
14 program benefits;
15 (c) The federal budget bill also reduced funding for
16 community-based outreach and application assistance in connection with
17 the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which play a critical role
-2- SB25B-003

1 in helping Coloradans access and retain program benefits;
2 (d) Outreach for the supplemental nutritional assistance program
3 promotes both equitable access and efficient, accurate administration of
4 the program, helping prevent avoidable payment errors while maintaining
5 access for all eligible people;
6 (e) The federal budget bill also eliminated the nation's only
7 dedicated nutrition education program for households that benefit from
8 the supplemental nutritional assistance program, ending over $6 million
9 in funding for Colorado and eliminating access to programs that are vital
10 for improving food security, dietary quality, and the ability to stretch
11 limited food budgets for 325,000 Coloradans including 30,000 families;
12 (f) The United States department of agriculture's data shows that
13 for every dollar spent on nutrition education, up to $10.64 is saved in
14 health-care spending;
15 (g) The supplemental nutritional assistance program education
16 directly reduces risk factors for conditions like diabetes, hypertension,
17 and obesity-chronic diseases that account for the bulk of health-care
18 costs;
19 (h) Nutrition education is even more critical when families face
20 steeper food prices and changes to the supplemental nutritional assistance
21 program structure and eligibility that result in families needing support in
22 doing more with less;
23 (i) Without investments in these programs, the hundreds of
24 thousands of Coloradans-including children, families, older adults,
25 veterans, and workers-who are eligible to receive supplemental nutritional
26 assistance program benefits are at risk of losing vital food assistance and
27 more Coloradans will go hungry;
-3- SB25B-003

1 (j) House Bill 25-1274 directed the secretary of state to submit
2 Proposition MM to the registered voters of the state to raise additional
3 revenue for the full implementation of the healthy school meals for all
4 program and its components, since the revenue raised in connection with
5 Proposition FF was insufficient to fund the full implementation of the
6 healthy school meals for all program and its components; and
7 (k) By modifying Proposition MM to support healthy food access
8 for Colorado kids and families and to allow excess money collected
9 beyond that necessary to fully fund and implement the healthy school
10 meals for all program to be used to support filling the gap in funding for
11 the supplemental nutritional assistance program caused by the reduced
12 funding for the program as a result of the federal budget bill, voter
13 approval of Proposition MM will ensure that all Coloradans have access
14 to the nutritious food they need to thrive.
15 SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 22-82.9-213, amend
16 (1) as follows:
17 22-82.9-213. Ballot issue related to Proposition FF revenue

20 their approval or rejection the following ballot issue: "Shall state taxes be
21 increased by $95 million annually by a change to the Colorado Revised
22 Statutes that, to support the healthy school meals for all program,
23 increases TO SUPPORT ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD FOR COLORADO KIDS
24 AND FAMILIES, INCLUDING THE HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL
