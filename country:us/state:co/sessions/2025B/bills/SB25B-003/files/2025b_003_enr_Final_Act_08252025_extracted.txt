CONCERNING SUPPORTING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD FOR COLORADANS,
AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AMENDING THE BALLOT ISSUE
LANGUAGE FOR A MEASURE ON THE NOVEMBER 2025 BALLOT AND
MODIFYING THE PERMISSIBLE USES OF THE HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS
FOR ALL CASH FUND.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:

Section 2:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
finds and declares that:
________
Capital letters or bold & italic numbers indicate new material added to existing law; dashes
through words or numbers indicate deletions from existing law and such material is not part of
the act.
(a) In July 2025, the United States Congress passed, and the
president signed into law, a federal budget bill, Pub.L. 119-21, that
significantly reduced funding for the supplemental nutritional assistance
program and shifted new and ongoing financial responsibilities to the states;
(b) These federal changes are projected to, starting in state fiscal
year 2026-27, impose at least $50 million in new annual costs to the state
of Colorado to administer the supplemental nutritional assistance program
and, in future years, potentially impose additional costs to the state of
Colorado to provide a portion of the supplemental nutritional assistance
program benefits;
(c) The federal budget bill also reduced funding for
community-based outreach and application assistance in connection with
the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which play a critical role in
helping Coloradans access and retain program benefits;
(d) Outreach for the supplemental nutritional assistance program
promotes both equitable access and efficient, accurate administration of the
program, helping prevent avoidable payment errors while maintaining
access for all eligible people;
(e) The federal budget bill also eliminated the nation's only
dedicated nutrition education program for households that benefit from the
supplemental nutritional assistance program, ending over $6 million in
funding for Colorado and eliminating access to programs that are vital for
improving food security, dietary quality, and the ability to stretch limited
food budgets for 325,000 Coloradans including 30,000 families;
(f) The United States department of agriculture's data shows that for
every dollar spent on nutrition education, up to $10.64 is saved in
health-care spending;
(g) The supplemental nutritional assistance program education
directly reduces risk factors for conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and
obesity-chronic diseases that account for the bulk of health-care costs;
(h) Nutrition education is even more critical when families face
steeper food prices and changes to the supplemental nutritional assistance
program structure and eligibility that result in families needing support in
PAGE 2-SENATE BILL 25B-003
doing more with less;
(i) Without investments in these programs, the hundreds of
thousands of Coloradans-including children, families, older adults, veterans,
and workers-who are eligible to receive supplemental nutritional assistance
program benefits are at risk of losing vital food assistance and more
Coloradans will go hungry;
(j) House Bill 25-1274 directed the secretary of state to submit
Proposition MM to the registered voters of the state to raise additional
revenue for the full implementation of the healthy school meals for all
program and its components, since the revenue raised in connection with
Proposition FF was insufficient to fund the full implementation of the
healthy school meals for all program and its components; and
(k) By modifying Proposition MM to support healthy food access
for Colorado kids and families and to allow excess money collected beyond
that necessary to fully fund and implement the healthy school meals for all
program to be used to support filling the gap in funding for the
supplemental nutritional assistance program caused by the reduced funding
for the program as a result of the federal budget bill, voter approval of
Proposition MM will ensure that all Coloradans have access to the
nutritious food they need to thrive.

Section 3:
SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 22-82.9-213, amend
(1) as follows:
22-82.9-213. Ballot issue related to Proposition FF revenue
increase - repeal. (1) At the statewide election held in November 2025, the
secretary of state shall submit to the registered electors of the state for their

increased by $95 million annually by a change to the Colorado Revised
Statutes that, to support the healthy school meals for all program, increases
TO SUPPORT ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD FOR COLORADO KIDS AND FAMILIES,
INCLUDING THE HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL PROGRAM, AND, IN
CONNECTION THEREWITH, INCREASING state taxable income only for
individuals who have a federal tax TAXABLE income of $300,000 or more
by limiting itemized or standard state income tax deductions to $1,000 for
single tax return filers and $2,000 for joint tax return filers for the purposes
of fully funding the healthy school meals for all program to continue paying
PAGE 3-SENATE BILL 25B-003
for public schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all public school
students while also increasing wages for employees who prepare and serve
school meals, helping schools use basic, nutritious ingredients, instead of
processed products, and ensuring that Colorado grown and raised products
are part of school meals; SUPPORTING THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP) THAT HELPS LOW-INCOME COLORADO
FAMILIES AFFORD GROCERIES; and shall the state be allowed ALLOWING THE
STATE to retain and spend as a voter-approved revenue change all additional
tax revenue generated by these tax deduction changes?"
