Current law requires that money deposited in the health insurance
affordability cash fund (fund) is allocated as specifically outlined in
statute for 2021 and each year thereafter. The bill requires the health
insurance affordability board to reevaluate the allocation of money
deposited in the fund on and after July 1, 2026, to:
! Prioritize the facilitation of reducing health coverage plan

premium increases and avoiding the loss of health coverage
plans for individuals in the individual market and
individuals who are unable to purchase health coverage
plans through the exchange; and
! Evaluate the costs of the state-subsidized individual health
coverage plans purchased by qualified individuals and
prioritize the reduction of the health coverage plan
premiums for documented residents.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds that:
4 (a) The health insurance affordability board has a responsibility
5 to prioritize documented Colorado residents when evaluating how to
6 allocate the revenue within its cash fund;
7 (b) Programs such as the OmniSalud program have limited the
8 ability of other programs within the Colorado health insurance
9 affordability enterprise to maximize their impact on documented
10 Coloradans' health insurance costs; and
11 (c) The health insurance affordability fee and the revenue it
12 creates need to be allocated to demonstrate responsible fiscal spending by
13 the Colorado health insurance affordability enterprise.
14 (2) Therefore, the general assembly declares that:
15 (a) The health insurance affordability board needs to evaluate and
16 prioritize programs that have a direct impact on our most vulnerable
17 communities, allocating additional funding to programs that have had a
18 clear, direct impact on Coloradans; and
19 (b) By directing money to documented residents, the state
20 demonstrates its commitment to tax-paying Coloradans and to protecting
21 those Coloradans who are at risk of losing their current health coverage
