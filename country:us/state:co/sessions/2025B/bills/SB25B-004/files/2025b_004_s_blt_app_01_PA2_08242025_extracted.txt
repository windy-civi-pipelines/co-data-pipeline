intelligence, or machine learning to generate a simplified
output or is capable, for a given set of human-defined
objectives, of making predictions or recommendations and
is used to assist, inform, or replace human
decision-making;
! Requires a developer of a system to, on and after February
1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to a deployer of the
system;
! Requires a deployer of a system to, on and after February

the system;
! Provides that a developer and deployer of a system are
jointly and severally liable for a violation of any law that
results from the deployer's use of the developer's system;
! Requires a person that makes available a generative

systems (provisions). The bill eliminates these provisions and:
Shading denotes HOUSE amendment. Double underlining denotes SENATE amendment.
Capital letters or bold & italic numbers indicate new material to be added to existing law.
Dashes through the words or numbers indicate deletions from existing law.

! Defines "algorithmic decision system" (system) to mean
any machine-based system or computational process that
uses statistical modeling, data analytics, artificial
intelligence, or machine learning to generate a simplified
output or is capable, for a given set of human-defined
objectives, of making predictions or recommendations and
is used to assist, inform, or replace human
decision-making;
! Requires a developer of a system to, on and after February
1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to a deployer of the
system;
! Requires a deployer of a system to, on and after February
1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to an individual who is
or will be affected by a decision made, informed, or
influenced by a system and provide the individual with a
procedure to correct the accuracy of data that was used by
the system;
! Provides that a developer and deployer of a system are
jointly and severally liable for a violation of any law that
results from the deployer's use of the developer's system;
! Requires a person that makes available a generative
artificial intelligence system to disclose to an individual
interacting with the generative artificial intelligence system
that the individual is interacting with a generative artificial
intelligence system;
! Clarifies that a violation of the bill's requirements is an
unfair or deceptive trade practice under the "Colorado
Consumer Protection Act"; and
