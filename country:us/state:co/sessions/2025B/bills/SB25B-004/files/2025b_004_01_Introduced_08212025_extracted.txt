In 2024, the general assembly enacted Senate Bill 24-205, which
created consumer protections in interactions with artificial intelligence
systems (provisions). The bill eliminates these provisions and:
! Defines "algorithmic decision system" (system) to mean
any machine-based system or computational process that
uses statistical modeling, data analytics, artificial

decision-making;
! Requires a developer of a system to, on and after February
1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to a deployer of the
system;
! Requires a deployer of a system to, on and after February
1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to an individual who is
or will be affected by a decision made, informed, or
influenced by a system and provide the individual with a
procedure to correct the accuracy of data that was used by
the system;
! Provides that a developer and deployer of a system are
jointly and severally liable for a violation of any law that
results from the deployer's use of the developer's system;
! Requires a person that makes available a generative
