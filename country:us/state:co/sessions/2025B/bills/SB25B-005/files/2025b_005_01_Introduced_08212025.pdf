resources division of parks and wildlife (division) for the reintroduction
of gray wolves. The bill requires the state treasurer to transfer a
corresponding amount from the general fund to the Colorado health
insurance affordability enterprise cash fund on September 1, 2025.
The bill also prohibits the division from using the money
appropriated from the general fund in state fiscal year 2025-26
(appropriated money) for the acquisition and reintroduction of gray
wolves or from taking any action to acquire or reintroduce gray wolves
during state fiscal year 2025-26. The division may use the appropriated
money to assist owners of livestock in preventing and resolving conflicts
between gray wolves and livestock and to pay fair compensation to
owners of livestock for any losses of livestock caused by gray wolves.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) Through the narrow passage of Proposition 114 by Colorado
5 voters in 2020, the division of parks and wildlife and the parks and
6 wildlife commission were directed to develop and implement a plan to
7 reintroduce gray wolves to Western Colorado while ensuring fair
8 compensation for livestock losses;
9 (b) According to the 2020 State Ballot Information Booklet,
10 published by the legislative council of the Colorado general assembly,
11 "Proposition 114 increases state spending by approximately $300,000 in
12 state budget year 2021-22 and $500,000 in state budget year 2022-23 for
13 public outreach and development of a gray wolf reintroduction plan.
14 Beginning in the state budget year 2023-24, spending will increase to
15 about $800,000 per year for the implementation of the wolf reintroduction
16 plan";
17 (c) Since state budget year 2023-24, the cost of the wolf
18 reintroduction program has far exceeded the $800,000 per year that was
19 estimated in the 2020 State Ballot Information Booklet. For just state
-2- SB25B-005

1 budget year 2024-25, the program cost the state $3,457,613, with funding
2 requirements for livestock conflict reduction and depredation
3 compensation expected to rise in the coming years.
4 (d) These cost overruns have occurred during a time when the
5 state government has had to make drastic cuts to state spending for
6 transportation infrastructure, Medicaid services, education, and more.
7 Now, with ongoing inflationary pressure, a substantial reduction in
8 available federal money for state operations due to the passage of H.R. 1
9 by the United States Congress, the expiration of health insurance
10 affordability tax credits that will cause insurance costs for Coloradans to
11 spike, and Colorado's balanced budget requirement, the state of Colorado
12 is faced with a challenging fiscal situation and Colorado families are at
13 risk of losing access to health insurance.
14 (e) Programmatically, Colorado's legal requirement to reintroduce
15 and establish a self-sustaining population of gray wolves has been
16 objectively successful: According to the division of parks and wildlife,
17 the wolves reintroduced into Colorado in late 2023 and early 2025 have
18 formed multiple packs and produced multiple litters of offspring and, as
19 of August 2025, there are over 30 wolves in Colorado with that number
20 anticipated to grow as more offspring from the current breeding season
21 are confirmed. Unfortunately, wolf-livestock conflict has only increased
22 as more wolves have been introduced and reproduced, which has further
23 escalated the cost of the wolf reintroduction program to taxpayers.
24 (f) Therefore, in the context of this extraordinary session called to
25 address an emerging budget and health insurance affordability crisis,
26 continued funding for the procurement of new wolves from other states
27 or other countries is not a responsible use of taxpayer dollars and
-3- SB25B-005

1 undermines the state's ability to lower costs for Coloradans' everyday
2 expenses. Colorado should spend money originally allocated for the
3 procurement, capture, transport, and release of new wolves on matters
4 more immediately impactful and beneficial to Colorado families while
5 retaining funding to support livestock producers and communities being
6 impacted by Colorado's existing and expanding wolf population.
7 (2) The general assembly further finds and declares that:
8 (a) In his Executive Order D 2025 009, "Call for the First
9 Extraordinary Session of the Seventy-Fifth General Assembly and
10 Directing a Statewide Hiring Freeze", Governor Polis directed the general
11 assembly to consider and pass legislation concerning, among other topics,
12 "adjustments to the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) to
13 facilitate a reduction in premium increases and avoid health insurance
14 coverage loss for those in the individual market and those unable to
15 purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado";
16 (b) As noted in the executive order and extraordinary session call
17 by the governor, "Congress's failure to extend enhanced Health Insurance
18 Premium Tax Credits, established by the American Rescue Plan Act of
19 2021 (ARPA) and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
20 (IRA), in concert with the 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability
21 Final Rule and individual market changes set forth in H.R.1, will have a
22 significant impact on health insurance rates in Colorado's individual
23 health insurance market, as well as broader market impacts. July 2025
24 rate filings by insurance carriers with the Colorado Division of Insurance
25 are, on average, 28% higher than 2025 rates with some requested rate
26 increases on Colorado's Western Slope of almost 40%. While the State
27 cannot extend federal premium tax credits, we can add funds to
-4- SB25B-005

1 Colorado's Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) in order to
2 mitigate the impact of these extraordinary individual health insurance
3 requested rate increases on individuals and families across the State.
4 Without this additional support, projected coverage losses will be
5 devastating for families and the health care system."
6 (c) While these health insurance increases would significantly and
7 negatively burden every part of Colorado, the price increases are
8 particularly acute for Western Slope counties-the same counties,
9 communities, businesses, and individuals being directly impacted by the
10 wolf reintroduction program.
11 (3) It is therefore the intent of the general assembly, in order to
12 address the governor's directive in the call for this extraordinary session
13 to fund the health insurance affordability enterprise, to not fund the
14 procurement of new wolves in the 2025-26 state fiscal year and reallocate
15 that money to the health insurance affordability enterprise, which will
16 help Coloradans and their families save money on their health insurance
17 premiums while protecting funding for the ongoing administration of
18 wolf-livestock conflict minimization and depredation compensation.
19 SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 10-16-1206, amend
20 (1)(g) and (1)(h); and add (1)(i) and (5) as follows:
21 10-16-1206. Health insurance affordability cash fund -

25 pursuant to section 25.5-4-503 (2); and
26 (h) Gifts, grants, or donations received from private or public
27 sources; AND
