resources division of parks and wildlife (division) for the reintroduction
of gray wolves. The bill requires the state treasurer to transfer a
corresponding amount from the general fund to the Colorado health
insurance affordability enterprise cash fund on September 1, 2025.
The bill also prohibits the division from using the money
appropriated from the general fund in state fiscal year 2025-26
(appropriated money) for the acquisition and reintroduction of gray
wolves or from taking any action to acquire or reintroduce gray wolves
during state fiscal year 2025-26. The division may use the appropriated
money to assist owners of livestock in preventing and resolving conflicts
between gray wolves and livestock and to pay fair compensation to
owners of livestock for any losses of livestock caused by gray wolves.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) Through the narrow passage of Proposition 114 by Colorado
5 voters in 2020, the division of parks and wildlife and the parks and
6 wildlife commission were directed to develop and implement a plan to
7 reintroduce gray wolves to Western Colorado while ensuring fair
8 compensation for livestock losses;
9 (b) Now, with ongoing inflationary pressure, a substantial
10 reduction in available federal money for state operations due to the
11 passage of H.R. 1 by the United States Congress, the expiration of health
12 insurance affordability tax credits that will cause insurance costs for
13 Coloradans to spike, and Colorado's balanced budget requirement, the
14 state of Colorado is faced with a challenging fiscal situation and Colorado
15 families are at risk of losing access to health insurance.
16 (c) Programmatically, Colorado's legal requirement to reintroduce
17 and establish a self-sustaining population of gray wolves is on a trajectory
18 to establish a sustainable population of wolves in Colorado: According
19 to the division of parks and wildlife, the wolves reintroduced into
-2- 005
1 Colorado in late 2023 and early 2025 have formed multiple packs and
2 produced multiple litters of offspring and, as of August 2025, there are 21
3 collared adult wolves, at least one known uncollared adult wolf, and an
4 estimated 9 or more pups from 4 breeding pairs in Colorado with that
5 number anticipated to grow as more offspring from the current breeding
6 season are confirmed.
7 (d) Therefore, in the context of this extraordinary session called
8 to address an emerging budget and health insurance affordability crisis,
9 other sources of funding outside of the general fund should be used
10 instead to procure new wolves from other states or other countries, to
11 enable the state to lower costs for Coloradans' everyday expenses.
12 Colorado should spend general fund money originally allocated for the
13 procurement, capture, transport, and release of new wolves on matters
14 more immediately impactful and beneficial to Colorado families while
15 retaining funding to support the wolf reintroduction and management
16 plan, including support for livestock producers and communities being
17 impacted by Colorado's existing and expanding wolf population.
18 (2) The general assembly further finds and declares that:
19 (a) In his Executive Order D 2025 009, "Call for the First
20 Extraordinary Session of the Seventy-Fifth General Assembly and
21 Directing a Statewide Hiring Freeze", Governor Polis directed the general
22 assembly to consider and pass legislation concerning, among other topics,
23 "adjustments to the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) to
24 facilitate a reduction in premium increases and avoid health insurance
25 coverage loss for those in the individual market and those unable to
26 purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado";
27 (b) As noted in the executive order and extraordinary session call
-3- 005
1 by the governor, "Congress's failure to extend enhanced Health Insurance
2 Premium Tax Credits, established by the American Rescue Plan Act of
3 2021 (ARPA) and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
4 (IRA), in concert with the 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability
5 Final Rule and individual market changes set forth in H.R.1, will have a
6 significant impact on health insurance rates in Colorado's individual
7 health insurance market, as well as broader market impacts. July 2025
8 rate filings by insurance carriers with the Colorado Division of Insurance
9 are, on average, 28% higher than 2025 rates with some requested rate
10 increases on Colorado's Western Slope of almost 40%. While the State
11 cannot extend federal premium tax credits, we can add funds to
12 Colorado's Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) in order to
13 mitigate the impact of these extraordinary individual health insurance
14 requested rate increases on individuals and families across the State.
15 Without this additional support, projected coverage losses will be
16 devastating for families and the health care system."
17 (c) While these health insurance increases would significantly and
18 negatively burden every part of Colorado, the price increases are
19 particularly acute for Western Slope counties-the same counties,
20 communities, businesses, and individuals being directly impacted by the
21 wolf reintroduction program.
22 (3) It is therefore the intent of the general assembly, in order to
23 address the governor's directive in the call for this extraordinary session,
24 to redirect general funds from the procurement of new wolves in the
25 2025-26 state fiscal year and reallocate that money to the health insurance
26 affordability enterprise, which will help Coloradans and their families
27 save money on their health insurance premiums while protecting funding

5 (1)(g) and (1)(h); and add (1)(i) and (5) as follows:
6 10-16-1206. Health insurance affordability cash fund -

8 insurance affordability cash fund. The fund consists of:
9 (g) The federal share of the medical assistance payments received
10 pursuant to section 25.5-4-503 (2); and
11 (h) Gifts, grants, or donations received from private or public
12 sources; AND
13 (i) ANY OTHER MONEY THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATED OR
14 TRANSFERRED TO THE FUND.
15 (5) (a) ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2025, THE STATE TREASURER SHALL
16 TRANSFER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED
17 SIXTY-EIGHT DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE FUND.
