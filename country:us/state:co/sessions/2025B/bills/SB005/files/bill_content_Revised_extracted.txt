Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) The bill reduces by $264,268 an appropriation for the 2025-26 state fiscal year from the general fund to the department of natural resources division of parks and wildlife (division) for the reintroduction of gray wolves. The bill requires the state treasurer to transfer a corresponding amount from the general fund to the Colorado health insurance affordability enterprise cash fund on September 1, 2025. The bill also prohibits the division from using the money appropriated from the general fund in state fiscal year 2025-26 (appropriated money) for the acquisition and reintroduction of gray wolves or from taking any action to acquire or reintroduce gray wolves during state fiscal year 2025-26. The division may use the appropriated money to assist owners of livestock in preventing and resolving conflicts between gray wolves and livestock and to pay fair compensation to owners of livestock for any losses of livestock caused by gray wolves. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that: Page 2, Line 3(a)Â Â Through the narrow passage of Proposition 114 by Colorado Page 2, Line 4voters in 2020, the division of parks and wildlife and the parks and Page 2, Line 5wildlife commission were directed to develop and implement a plan to Page 2, Line 6reintroduce gray wolves to Western Colorado while ensuring fair compensation for livestock losses; Page 2, Line 7Â (b)Â Â Now, with ongoing inflationary pressure, a substantial Page 2, Line 8reduction in available federal money for state operations due to the Page 2, Line 9passage of H.R. 1 by the United States Congress, the expiration of health Page 2, Line 10insurance affordability tax credits that will cause insurance costs for Page 2, Line 11Coloradans to spike, and Colorado's balanced budget requirement, the Page 2, Line 12state of Colorado is faced with a challenging fiscal situation and Colorado families are at risk of losing access to health insurance. Page 2, Line 13(c)Â Â Programmatically, Colorado's legal requirement to reintroduce Page 2, Line 14and establish a self-sustaining population of gray wolves is on a trajectory Page 2, Line 15to establish a sustainable population of wolves in Colorado: According Page 2, Line 16to the division of parks and wildlife, the wolves reintroduced into Page 3, Line 1Colorado in late 2023 and early 2025 have formed multiple packs and Page 3, Line 2produced multiple litters of offspring and, as of August 2025, there are 21 Page 3, Line 3collared adult wolves, at least one known uncollared adult wolf, and an Page 3, Line 4estimated 9 or more pups from 4 breeding pairs in Colorado with that Page 3, Line 5number anticipated to grow as more offspring from the current breeding season are confirmed. Page 3, Line 6(d)Â Â Therefore, in the context of this extraordinary session called Page 3, Line 7to address an emerging budget and health insurance affordability crisis, Page 3, Line 8other sources of funding outside of the general fund should be used Page 3, Line 9instead to procure new wolves from other states or other countries, to Page 3, Line 10enable the state to lower costs for Coloradans' everyday expenses. Page 3, Line 11Colorado should spend general fund money originally allocated for the Page 3, Line 12procurement, capture, transport, and release of new wolves on matters Page 3, Line 13immediately impactful to Colorado families by retaining general fund Page 3, Line 14money to support livestock producers and communities being impacted Page 3, Line 15by Colorado's existing and expanding wolf population, and requiring the Page 3, Line 16division of parks and wildlife to use other sources of funding for additional wolf relocations in state fiscal year 2025-26. Page 3, Line 17(2)Â Â The general assembly further finds and declares that: Page 3, Line 18(a)Â Â In his Executive Order D 2025 009, "Call for the First Page 3, Line 19Extraordinary Session of the Seventy-Fifth General Assembly and Page 3, Line 20Directing a Statewide Hiring Freeze", Governor Polis directed the general Page 3, Line 21assembly to consider and pass legislation concerning, among other topics, Page 3, Line 22"adjustments to the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) to Page 3, Line 23facilitate a reduction in premium increases and avoid health insurance Page 3, Line 24coverage loss for those in the individual market and those unable to Page 3, Line 25purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado"; Page 4, Line 1(b)Â Â As noted in the executive order and extraordinary session call Page 4, Line 2by the governor, "Congress's failure to extend enhanced Health Insurance Page 4, Line 3Premium Tax Credits, established by the American Rescue Plan Act of Page 4, Line 42021 (ARPA) and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Page 4, Line 5(IRA), in concert with the 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Page 4, Line 6Final Rule and individual market changes set forth in H.R.1, will have a Page 4, Line 7significant impact on health insurance rates in Colorado's individual Page 4, Line 8health insurance market, as well as broader market impacts. July 2025 Page 4, Line 9rate filings by insurance carriers with the Colorado Division of Insurance Page 4, Line 10are, on average, 28% higher than 2025 rates with some requested rate Page 4, Line 11increases on Colorado's Western Slope of almost 40%. While the State Page 4, Line 12cannot extend federal premium tax credits, we can add funds to Page 4, Line 13Colorado's Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) in order to Page 4, Line 14mitigate the impact of these extraordinary individual health insurance Page 4, Line 15requested rate increases on individuals and families across the State. Page 4, Line 16Without this additional support, projected coverage losses will be devastating for families and the health care system." Page 4, Line 17(c)Â Â While these health insurance increases would significantly and Page 4, Line 18negatively burden every part of Colorado, the price increases are Page 4, Line 19particularly acute for Western Slope counties-the same counties, Page 4, Line 20communities, businesses, and individuals being directly impacted by the wolf reintroduction program. Page 4, Line 21(3)Â Â It is therefore the intent of the general assembly, in order to Page 4, Line 22address the governor's directive in the call for this extraordinary session, Page 4, Line 23to redirect general funds from the procurement of new wolves in the Page 4, Line 242025-26 state fiscal year and reallocate that money to the health insurance Page 4, Line 25affordability enterprise, which will help Coloradans and their families Page 5, Line 1save money on their health insurance premiums while protecting funding Page 5, Line 2for the implementation of the wolf reintroduction and management plan, Page 5, Line 3including the ongoing administration of wolf-livestock conflict minimization and depredation compensation.

(1)Â Â There is created in the state treasury the health insurance affordability cash fund. The fund consists of: Page 5, Line 7(g)Â Â The federal share of the medical assistance payments received pursuant to section 25.5-4-503 (2); and Page 5, Line 8(h)Â Â Gifts, grants, or donations received from private or public sources; and Page 5, Line 9(i)Â Â Any other money that may be appropriated or transferred to the fund. Page 5, Line 10(5)Â (a)Â Â On September 1, 2025, the state treasurer shall Page 5, Line 11transfer two hundred sixty-four thousand two hundred sixty-eight dollars from the general fund to the fund.

The bill requires the state treasurer to transfer a corresponding amount from the general fund to the Colorado health insurance affordability enterprise cash fund on September 1, 2025.
