Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) The bill reduces by $264,268 an appropriation for the 2025-26 state fiscal year from the general fund to the department of natural resources division of parks and wildlife (division) for the reintroduction of gray wolves. The bill requires the state treasurer to transfer a corresponding amount from the general fund to the Colorado health insurance affordability enterprise cash fund on September 1, 2025. The bill also prohibits the division from using the money appropriated from the general fund in state fiscal year 2025-26 (appropriated money) for the acquisition and reintroduction of gray wolves or from taking any action to acquire or reintroduce gray wolves during state fiscal year 2025-26. The division may use the appropriated money to assist owners of livestock in preventing and resolving conflicts between gray wolves and livestock and to pay fair compensation to owners of livestock for any losses of livestock caused by gray wolves. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that: Page 2, Line 3(a)Â Â Through the narrow passage of Proposition 114 by Colorado Page 2, Line 4voters in 2020, the division of parks and wildlife and the parks and Page 2, Line 5wildlife commission were directed to develop and implement a plan to Page 2, Line 6reintroduce gray wolves to Western Colorado while ensuring fair compensation for livestock losses; Page 2, Line 7(b)Â Â According to the 2020 State Ballot Information Booklet, Page 2, Line 8published by the legislative council of the Colorado general assembly, Page 2, Line 9"Proposition 114 increases state spending by approximately $300,000 in Page 2, Line 10state budget year 2021-22 and $500,000 in state budget year 2022-23 for Page 2, Line 11public outreach and development of a gray wolf reintroduction plan. Page 2, Line 12Beginning in the state budget year 2023-24, spending will increase to Page 2, Line 13about $800,000 per year for the implementation of the wolf reintroduction plan"; Page 2, Line 14(c)Â Â Since state budget year 2023-24, the cost of the wolf Page 2, Line 15reintroduction program has far exceeded the $800,000 per year that was Page 2, Line 16estimated in the 2020 State Ballot Information Booklet. For just state Page 3, Line 1budget year 2024-25, the program cost the state $3,457,613, with funding Page 3, Line 2requirements for livestock conflict reduction and depredation compensation expected to rise in the coming years. Page 3, Line 3(d)Â Â These cost overruns have occurred during a time when the Page 3, Line 4state government has had to make drastic cuts to state spending for Page 3, Line 5transportation infrastructure, Medicaid services, education, and more. Page 3, Line 6Now, with ongoing inflationary pressure, a substantial reduction in Page 3, Line 7available federal money for state operations due to the passage of H.R. 1 Page 3, Line 8by the United States Congress, the expiration of health insurance Page 3, Line 9affordability tax credits that will cause insurance costs for Coloradans to Page 3, Line 10spike, and Colorado's balanced budget requirement, the state of Colorado Page 3, Line 11is faced with a challenging fiscal situation and Colorado families are at risk of losing access to health insurance. Page 3, Line 12(e)Â Â Programmatically, Colorado's legal requirement to reintroduce Page 3, Line 13and establish a self-sustaining population of gray wolves has been Page 3, Line 14objectively successful: According to the division of parks and wildlife, Page 3, Line 15the wolves reintroduced into Colorado in late 2023 and early 2025 have Page 3, Line 16formed multiple packs and produced multiple litters of offspring and, as Page 3, Line 17of August 2025, there are over 30 wolves in Colorado with that number Page 3, Line 18anticipated to grow as more offspring from the current breeding season Page 3, Line 19are confirmed. Unfortunately, wolf-livestock conflict has only increased Page 3, Line 20as more wolves have been introduced and reproduced, which has further escalated the cost of the wolf reintroduction program to taxpayers. Page 3, Line 21(f)Â Â Therefore, in the context of this extraordinary session called to Page 3, Line 22address an emerging budget and health insurance affordability crisis, Page 3, Line 23continued funding for the procurement of new wolves from other states Page 3, Line 24or other countries is not a responsible use of taxpayer dollars and Page 4, Line 1undermines the state's ability to lower costs for Coloradans' everyday Page 4, Line 2expenses. Colorado should spend money originally allocated for the Page 4, Line 3procurement, capture, transport, and release of new wolves on matters Page 4, Line 4more immediately impactful and beneficial to Colorado families while Page 4, Line 5retaining funding to support livestock producers and communities being impacted by Colorado's existing and expanding wolf population. Page 4, Line 6(2)Â Â The general assembly further finds and declares that: Page 4, Line 7(a)Â Â In his Executive Order D 2025 009, "Call for the First Page 4, Line 8Extraordinary Session of the Seventy-Fifth General Assembly and Page 4, Line 9Directing a Statewide Hiring Freeze", Governor Polis directed the general Page 4, Line 10assembly to consider and pass legislation concerning, among other topics, Page 4, Line 11"adjustments to the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) to Page 4, Line 12facilitate a reduction in premium increases and avoid health insurance Page 4, Line 13coverage loss for those in the individual market and those unable to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado"; Page 4, Line 14(b)Â Â As noted in the executive order and extraordinary session call Page 4, Line 15by the governor, "Congress's failure to extend enhanced Health Insurance Page 4, Line 16Premium Tax Credits, established by the American Rescue Plan Act of Page 4, Line 172021 (ARPA) and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Page 4, Line 18(IRA), in concert with the 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Page 4, Line 19Final Rule and individual market changes set forth in H.R.1, will have a Page 4, Line 20significant impact on health insurance rates in Colorado's individual Page 4, Line 21health insurance market, as well as broader market impacts.

While the State Page 4, Line 25cannot extend federal premium tax credits, we can add funds to Page 5, Line 1Colorado's Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) in order to Page 5, Line 2mitigate the impact of these extraordinary individual health insurance Page 5, Line 3requested rate increases on individuals and families across the State. Page 5, Line 4Without this additional support, projected coverage losses will be devastating for families and the health care system." Page 5, Line 5(c)Â Â While these health insurance increases would significantly and Page 5, Line 6negatively burden every part of Colorado, the price increases are Page 5, Line 7particularly acute for Western Slope counties-the same counties, Page 5, Line 8communities, businesses, and individuals being directly impacted by the wolf reintroduction program. Page 5, Line 9(3)Â Â It is therefore the intent of the general assembly, in order to Page 5, Line 10address the governor's directive in the call for this extraordinary session Page 5, Line 11to fund the health insurance affordability enterprise, to not fund the Page 5, Line 12procurement of new wolves in the 2025-26 state fiscal year and reallocate Page 5, Line 13that money to the health insurance affordability enterprise, which will Page 5, Line 14help Coloradans and their families save money on their health insurance Page 5, Line 15premiums while protecting funding for the ongoing administration of wolf-livestock conflict minimization and depredation compensation.
