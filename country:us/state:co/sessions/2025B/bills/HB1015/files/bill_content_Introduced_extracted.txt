If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) The bill prohibits the department of health care policy and financing (HCPF) from reimbursing a: Health-care provider who, or entity or facility that, performs, assists in the performance of, or refers a person to abortion or gender-affirming health-care services; or A health-care provider, entity, or facility for providing medical services to a person who does not satisfy citizenship or residency requirements.

The bill repeals the programs and makes related conforming amendments. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds that: Page 2, Line 3(a)Â Â In order to preserve access to the state's medicaid health Page 2, Line 4services, Colorado must prioritize essential health-care coverage for the most vulnerable populations in the state; Page 2, Line 5(b)Â Â Low-income children and families, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities rely on medicaid as an essential service that is a lifeline; Page 2, Line 6(c)Â Â In pursuit of sustaining long-term funding for the state's Page 2, Line 7medicaid health services for Colorado citizens, the state must correctly Page 2, Line 8allocate funding to essential health services that have a direct impact on Colorado citizens' health; Page 2, Line 9(d)Â Â Health first Colorado, Colorado's medicaid program, should Page 2, Line 10not cover elective procedures. It should only cover procedures that are medically necessary for Colorado citizens. Page 2, Line 11(e)Â Â Previously, due to insufficient data, the state was unable to Page 3, Line 1accurately estimate the costs of Cover All Coloradans, OmniSalud, Page 3, Line 2abortion, and gender mutilation. These fiscal impacts have led to a large Page 3, Line 3discrepancy between the estimated costs and the true impact on health coverage for Colorado citizens. Page 3, Line 4(f)Â Â Now, it is estimated that the state has spent $51 million on Page 3, Line 5Cover All Coloradans, $90 million on OmniSalud, $6 million on Page 3, Line 6abortions, and $4.5 million on gender mutilation, totaling over $150 million that could otherwise be spent on Colorado citizens; Page 3, Line 7(g)Â Â While over $150 million is spent on elective procedures for Page 3, Line 8individuals and health-care coverage for undocumented individuals, Colorado is anticipating a 28% increase in premiums in 2026; and Page 3, Line 9(h)Â Â Although Amendment 79 permits the use of public funds for Page 3, Line 10abortion, it does not explicitly require public funds to be used for abortion. Page 3, Line 11(2)Â Â Therefore, the general assembly declares that state medicaid Page 3, Line 12funding must not be used for abortion or gender mutilation for an Page 3, Line 13individual, or health services for an undocumented individual. These Page 3, Line 14limitations will protect Colorado's commitment to prioritizing and Page 3, Line 15protecting essential health-care coverage for the most vulnerable Page 3, Line 16populations in the state and supporting the ethical use of taxpayer dollars that align with the state's core values. Page 3, Line 17SECTIONÂ 2.Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 25.5-4-415.5 as follows: Page 3, Line 1825.5-4-415.5.Â Â Prohibition on reimbursement for abortion or Page 3, Line 19gender-affirming health-care services - prohibition on Page 3, Line 20reimbursement for medical services to a person who is not lawfully Page 3, Line 21residing - definitions.

Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) The bill prohibits the department of health care policy and financing (HCPF) from reimbursing a: Health-care provider who, or entity or facility that, performs, assists in the performance of, or refers a person to abortion or gender-affirming health-care services; or A health-care provider, entity, or facility for providing medical services to a person who does not satisfy citizenship or residency requirements. The bill makes related conforming amendments. Under current law, HCPF administers the reproductive health-care program, the state medical assistance program, and the state children's basic health plan (collectively, "the programs") to certain individuals who are ineligible for the programs due to their immigration status. The bill repeals the programs and makes related conforming amendments. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds that: Page 2, Line 3(a)Â Â In order to preserve access to the state's medicaid health Page 2, Line 4services, Colorado must prioritize essential health-care coverage for the most vulnerable populations in the state; Page 2, Line 5(b)Â Â Low-income children and families, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities rely on medicaid as an essential service that is a lifeline; Page 2, Line 6(c)Â Â In pursuit of sustaining long-term funding for the state's Page 2, Line 7medicaid health services for Colorado citizens, the state must correctly Page 2, Line 8allocate funding to essential health services that have a direct impact on Colorado citizens' health; Page 2, Line 9(d)Â Â Health first Colorado, Colorado's medicaid program, should Page 2, Line 10not cover elective procedures. It should only cover procedures that are medically necessary for Colorado citizens. Page 2, Line 11(e)Â Â Previously, due to insufficient data, the state was unable to Page 3, Line 1accurately estimate the costs of Cover All Coloradans, OmniSalud, Page 3, Line 2abortion, and gender mutilation. These fiscal impacts have led to a large Page 3, Line 3discrepancy between the estimated costs and the true impact on health coverage for Colorado citizens. Page 3, Line 4(f)Â Â Now, it is estimated that the state has spent $51 million on Page 3, Line 5Cover All Coloradans, $90 million on OmniSalud, $6 million on Page 3, Line 6abortions, and $4.5 million on gender mutilation, totaling over $150 million that could otherwise be spent on Colorado citizens; Page 3, Line 7(g)Â Â While over $150 million is spent on elective procedures for Page 3, Line 8individuals and health-care coverage for undocumented individuals, Colorado is anticipating a 28% increase in premiums in 2026; and Page 3, Line 9(h)Â Â Although Amendment 79 permits the use of public funds for Page 3, Line 10abortion, it does not explicitly require public funds to be used for abortion. Page 3, Line 11(2)Â Â Therefore, the general assembly declares that state medicaid Page 3, Line 12funding must not be used for abortion or gender mutilation for an Page 3, Line 13individual, or health services for an undocumented individual. These Page 3, Line 14limitations will protect Colorado's commitment to prioritizing and Page 3, Line 15protecting essential health-care coverage for the most vulnerable Page 3, Line 16populations in the state and supporting the ethical use of taxpayer dollars that align with the state's core values. Page 3, Line 17SECTIONÂ 2.Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 25.5-4-415.5 as follows: Page 3, Line 1825.5-4-415.5.Â Â Prohibition on reimbursement for abortion or Page 3, Line 19gender-affirming health-care services - prohibition on Page 3, Line 20reimbursement for medical services to a person who is not lawfully Page 3, Line 21residing - definitions.
