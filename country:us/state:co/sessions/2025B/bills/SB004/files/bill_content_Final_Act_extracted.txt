Concerning measures effective no later than June 30, 2026, to increase transparency for algorithmic systems. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, 6-1-1702, amend (1), (2) introductory portion, (3)(a), (4)(a) introductory portion, (5) introductory portion, and (7) as follows: 6-1-1702.Â Â Developer duty to avoid algorithmic discrimination - required documentation. (1)Â Â On and after February 1, 2026June 30, 2026, a developer of a high-risk artificial intelligence system shall use reasonable care to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination arising from the intended and contracted uses of the high-risk artificial intelligence system. In any enforcement action brought on or after February 1, 2026June 30, 2026, by the attorney general pursuant to section 6-1-1706, there is a rebuttable presumption that a developer used reasonable care as required under this section if the developer complied with this section and any additional requirements or obligations as set forth in rules promulgatedadopted by the attorney general pursuant to section 6-1-1707. (2)Â Â On and after February 1, 2026June 30, 2026, and except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a developer of a high-risk artificial intelligence system shall make available to the deployer or other developer of the high-risk artificial intelligence system: (3)Â (a)Â Â Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a developer that offers, sells, leases, licenses, gives, or otherwise makes available to a deployer or other developer a high-risk artificial intelligence system on or after February 1, 2026June 30, 2026, shall make available to the deployer or other developer, to the extent feasible, the documentation and information, through artifacts such as model cards, dataset cards, or other impact assessments, necessary for a deployer, or for a third party contracted by a deployer, to complete an impact assessment pursuant to section 6-1-1703 (3). (4)Â (a)Â Â On and after February 1, 2026June 30, 2026, a developer shall make available, in a manner that is clear and readily available on the developer's website or in a public use case inventory, a statement summarizing: (5)Â Â On and after February 1, 2026June 30, 2026, a developer of a high-risk artificial intelligence system shall disclose to the attorney general, in a form and manner prescribed by the attorney general, and to all known deployers or other developers of the high-risk artificial intelligence system, any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination arising from the intended uses of the high-risk artificial intelligence system without unreasonable delay but no later than ninety days after the date on which: (7)Â Â On and after February 1, 2026June 30, 2026, the attorney general may require that a developer disclose to the attorney general, no later than ninety days after the request and in a form and manner prescribed by the attorney general, the statement or documentation described in subsection (2) of this section.
