If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) In 2024, the general assembly enacted Senate Bill 24-205, which created consumer protections in interactions with artificial intelligence systems (provisions). The bill eliminates these provisions and: Defines "algorithmic decision system" (system) to mean any machine-based system or computational process that uses statistical modeling, data analytics, artificial intelligence, or machine learning to generate a simplified output or is capable, for a given set of human-defined objectives, of making predictions or recommendations and is used to assist, inform, or replace human decision-making; Requires a developer of a system to, on and after February 1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to a deployer of the system; Requires a deployer of a system to, on and after February 1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to an individual who is or will be affected by a decision made, informed, or influenced by a system and provide the individual with a procedure to correct the accuracy of data that was used by the system; Provides that a developer and deployer of a system are jointly and severally liable for a violation of any law that results from the deployer's use of the developer's system; Requires a person that makes available a generative artificial intelligence system to disclose to an individual interacting with the generative artificial intelligence system that the individual is interacting with a generative artificial intelligence system; Clarifies that a violation of the bill's requirements is an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the "Colorado Consumer Protection Act"; and Permits the attorney general to adopt rules implementing the provisions of the bill.

The bill eliminates these provisions and: Defines "algorithmic decision system" (system) to mean any machine-based system or computational process that uses statistical modeling, data analytics, artificial intelligence, or machine learning to generate a simplified output or is capable, for a given set of human-defined objectives, of making predictions or recommendations and is used to assist, inform, or replace human decision-making; Requires a developer of a system to, on and after February 1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to a deployer of the system; Requires a deployer of a system to, on and after February 1, 2026, provide certain disclosures to an individual who is or will be affected by a decision made, informed, or influenced by a system and provide the individual with a procedure to correct the accuracy of data that was used by the system; Provides that a developer and deployer of a system are jointly and severally liable for a violation of any law that results from the deployer's use of the developer's system; Requires a person that makes available a generative artificial intelligence system to disclose to an individual interacting with the generative artificial intelligence system that the individual is interacting with a generative artificial intelligence system; Clarifies that a violation of the bill's requirements is an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the "Colorado Consumer Protection Act"; and Permits the attorney general to adopt rules implementing the provisions of the bill.
