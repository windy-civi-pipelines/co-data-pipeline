intelligence system must disclose to a consumer when the consumer is
interacting with the artificial intelligence system and not with a human in
certain circumstances. The bill establishes certain requirements for claims
brought by the attorney general and parameters for court orders resulting
from those claims. The attorney general may adopt rules for the
implementation and enforcement of this provision of the bill.
A developer of an artificial intelligence system is also subject to
the provisions of the "Colorado Anti-discrimination Act" if the artificial
intelligence system is deployed in a way that violates the "Colorado
Anti-discrimination Act". An individual may file a complaint with the
Colorado civil rights division against the developer if the developer's
artificial intelligence system discriminates against the individual in
certain circumstances.
The bill requires that contracts entered into by a Colorado public
school, a state agency, or other public entity comply with the provisions
of the "Colorado Consumer Protection Act" or the "Colorado
Anti-discrimination Act" in relation to the use and deployment of
artificial intelligence systems and that a contractor agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless a state agency or public entity.
