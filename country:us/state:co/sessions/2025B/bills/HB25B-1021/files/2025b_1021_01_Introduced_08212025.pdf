some retailers to retain a sales tax vendor fee to cover the retailer's
expenses incurred in collecting and remitting state sales tax (vendor fee).
For sales made on or after January 1, 2026, the bill increases the
maximum dollar amount that a retailer may retain as a vendor fee from

$1,000 to $2,000. Beginning on January 1, 2026, the bill requires that:
! The percentage of sales tax reported that a retailer may
retain as a vendor fee must never fall below 2% of the tax
reported; and
! The maximum dollar amount that a retailer may retain in
any filing period as a vendor fee must never fall below
$2,000.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) Small retailers are the backbone of Colorado's economy and
5 a vital part of the communities they serve. From main street shops to
6 family-run businesses, small retailers provide jobs, sponsor local events,
7 and keep dollars circulating in Colorado's neighborhoods.
8 (b) Colorado's retail sector faces a growing burden from
9 ever-increasing regulations, compliance requirements, and administrative
10 costs. The vendor fee, allowing retailers to retain a small percentage of
11 the state sales tax they collect, was created to help offset those costs and
12 recognize the important role that small businesses play in collecting and
13 remitting sales tax revenue on behalf of the state.
14 (c) Current law permits retailers that make less than $1 million per
15 filing period in taxable sales income to keep 4% of the state sales tax that
16 they collect, up to $1,000 per filing period. This cap has not kept pace
17 with rising costs, making it harder for small retailers to absorb the impact
18 of regulatory changes and inflation.
19 (d) The general assembly intends to strengthen support to retailers
20 by increasing the maximum vendor fee retention cap to $2,000 per filing
21 period. This adjustment will help small retailers remain competitive,
22 protect local jobs, and sustain the economic vitality of communities
