Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Current law lists certain foreign jurisdictions in which a C corporation is presumptively incorporated for the purpose of avoiding state corporate income tax and allows a C corporation to rebut that presumption by proving to the satisfaction of the executive director of the department of revenue (executive director) that the C corporation is incorporated in the listed foreign jurisdiction for reasons that meet the economic substance doctrine described in the federal internal revenue code. The bill permits the executive director to, without proof from the C corporation, use discretion to determine that a C corporation is not incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction for the purpose of tax avoidance. The bill adds Hong Kong, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, and Singapore to the list of foreign jurisdictions in which a C corporation is presumptively incorporated for the purpose of avoiding state corporate income tax. Â Â For income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2026, for the purposes of determining the amount of corporate income tax that a C corporation owes to the state, the bill adds to a C corporation's federal taxable income an amount equal to a federal deduction claimed for the income tax year for foreign-derived deduction eligible income that was allowed under the federal internal revenue code. Current law provides that dividends from foreign subsidiaries that must be added to a C corporation's federal taxable income under the federal internal revenue code may be subtracted from the C corporation's federal taxable income for the purposes of determining the amount of corporate income tax that a C corporation owes to the state; except that such dividends received from a C corporation incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction for the purpose of tax avoidance cannot be subtracted. The bill changes this subtraction so that all dividends from foreign subsidiaries that must be added to a C corporation's federal taxable income under the federal internal revenue code may be subtracted from the C corporation's federal taxable income for the purposes of determining the amount of corporate income tax that a C corporation owes to the state. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that: Page 2, Line 3(a)Â (I)Â Â The purpose of defining listed jurisdictions for purposes of Page 2, Line 4corporate income tax is to decrease corporate income tax avoidance in Colorado. This is a continuation of existing tax policy. Page 2, Line 5(II)Â Â Additional foreign jurisdictions must be included in the Page 2, Line 6current list to accurately reflect the foreign jurisdictions that are used by C corporations for the purpose of tax avoidance. Page 2, Line 7(III)Â Â The clarification of listed jurisdictions will decrease tax Page 3, Line 1avoidance by creating a more accurate list of foreign jurisdictions used by C corporations for the purpose of tax avoidance. Page 3, Line 2(b)Â (I)Â Â In 2017, as part of the federal "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act", Page 3, Line 3Pub.L. 115-97, Congress created the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income Page 3, Line 4("FDII") tax deduction. Federal Public Law 119-21 lowered the rate for Page 3, Line 5the FDII deduction and renamed it the foreign-derived deduction eligible Page 3, Line 6income ("FDDEI") tax deduction for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Page 3, Line 7(II)Â Â The FDDEI deduction provides a tax benefit to corporations Page 3, Line 8that do business outside of the United States. Such corporations also Page 3, Line 9receive other substantial tax reductions from other Colorado tax laws. In Page 3, Line 10addition, most FDDEI deductions claimed for state income tax purposes Page 3, Line 11are claimed by corporations that maintain the majority of their property and investments outside of Colorado. Page 3, Line 12(III)Â Â The primary purpose of adding the FDDEI deduction back to Page 3, Line 13taxable income for state income tax purposes is to encourage tax Page 3, Line 14compliance by promoting tax simplicity, equalization, and fairness. The Page 3, Line 15revenue gain from this add-back is incidental to the primary purpose of Page 3, Line 16encouraging tax compliance and promoting tax simplicity, equalization, and fairness for Colorado taxpayers. Page 3, Line 17(IV)Â Â Any revenue gain resulting from the FDDEI deduction add-back is de minimis. Page 3, Line 18(c)Â Â Therefore, consistent with the Colorado supreme court's Page 3, Line 19holding in TABOR Found. v. Reg'l Transp. Dist., 2018 CO 29, that Page 3, Line 20legislation that causes only an incidental and de minimis tax revenue Page 3, Line 21increase does not amount to a new tax or a tax policy change that requires Page 3, Line 22advance voter approval under section 20 of article X of the Colorado Page 4, Line 1constitution, the FDDEI deduction add-back is neither a new tax nor a tax policy change that requires voter approval. Page 4, Line 2SECTIONÂ 2.Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, 39-22-303, amend (8)(b)(II) and (12)(b) as follows: Page 4, Line 339-22-303.Â Â Dividends in a combined report - foreign source Page 4, Line 4income - affiliated groups - definitions - rules - repeal. (8)Â (b)Â (II)Â Â A Page 4, Line 5C corporation is presumptively incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction for Page 4, Line 6the purpose of tax avoidance if it is incorporated in a listed jurisdiction. Page 4, Line 7A C corporation is not incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction for the Page 4, Line 8purpose of tax avoidance if the taxpayer proves to the satisfaction of the Page 4, Line 9executive director, or if the executive director determines, that such Page 4, Line 10corporation is incorporated in a listed jurisdiction for reasons that meet Page 4, Line 11the economic substance doctrine described in section 7701 (o) of the internal revenue code.
