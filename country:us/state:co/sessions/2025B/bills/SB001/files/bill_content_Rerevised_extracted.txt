Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Under existing law, the governor is permitted to, by executive order, suspend or discontinue the functions or services of state government (discretionary spending reductions) when there are not sufficient revenues available to carry on the functions of the state government. The bill relocates the provisions of law allowing the governor to make discretionary spending reductions and requires the governor to promptly notify the joint budget committee (JBC) of the executive order. As soon as practicable after receiving the notification, the JBC shall hold a meeting to discuss the governor's plans for discretionary spending reductions. At the meeting, the governor or the office of state planning and budgeting (OSPB), or both, shall present the executive order to the JBC and the JBC may provide advice regarding discretionary spending reductions. Under existing law, the governor is required to formulate and implement a plan to reduce general fund expenditures when the governor's regular quarterly revenue estimate indicates that appropriations from the general fund then in effect will result in either using more than one-half of the required amount of general fund reserve (reserve) or the balance of the reserve dropping to below $1 billion (required spending reductions). In addition to the regular quarterly revenue estimate trigger, the bill adds as a required spending reduction trigger for the governor that an updated regular quarterly revenue estimate indicates that the state needs to use an amount of the reserve equal to the lesser of 2% of general fund appropriations for the fiscal year or one-half of the required reserve, or when the balance of the reserve drops to below $1 billion. Under existing law, the governor promptly notifies the general assembly of a required spending reduction plan. The bill requires the JBC to hold a meeting as soon as practicable after receiving the notification. At the meeting, the governor or OSPB, or both, shall present the plan to the JBC and the JBC may provide advice regarding the plan.
