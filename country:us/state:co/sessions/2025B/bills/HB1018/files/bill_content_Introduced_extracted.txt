Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Section 3 of the bill creates a mechanism for temporarily suspending or prorating all income tax credits, excluding the Colorado affordable housing tax credit and the earned income tax credits (income tax credits), based on estimates of the state's revenue. Beginning with the December 2025 quarterly revenue forecast, each quarterly revenue forecast in June, September, or December, and any interim revenue estimate given between quarterly forecasts, must include 2 estimates of the amount of excess state revenues in relation to the income tax credits available. Excess state revenues, for purposes of these estimates, means the total amount of revenue collected by the state during the state fiscal year in excess of the limitation on state fiscal year spending imposed by the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights that voters statewide have not authorized the state to retain and spend, less: The reimbursement to local governments to offset the reduction in property taxes resulting from property tax exemptions for qualifying seniors, veterans with disabilities, and spouses of veterans who died in the line of duty or as a result of a service-related injury or disease; the reimbursement to local governments to offset the reduction in property taxes resulting from the reduced valuation for assessment of qualified-senior primary residences; and any temporary income tax rate reduction in effect. These estimates are: An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins, assuming all income tax credits are available in the following income tax year; and An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins, assuming no income tax credits are available in the following income tax year. The estimate without income tax credits results in the least amount of excess revenue, then no income tax credits are available for the applicable income tax year; or The estimate with income tax credits results in the least amount of excess revenue, then all income tax credits are available for the applicable income tax year and are prorated so that the maximum total amount of each income tax credit claimed by all taxpayers claiming that credit does not exceed the amount equal to the estimated excess state revenues divided by the total number of income tax credits available during the applicable income tax year. The credit for the sale of new, electric-powered lawn equipment for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2027. Under existing law, this credit is allowed to qualified retailers who sell new, electric-powered lawn equipment and offer a discount on the purchase price (section 4); The credit for the installation of heat pump technology or a thermal energy network for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit is allowed to eligible taxpayers who meet certain industry criteria and install heat pump technology or a thermal energy network, if the eligible taxpayer provides a discount from the amount charged for installation (section 5); and The credit for the sale of new qualified electric bicycles for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit is allowed to qualified retailers who sell a qualified electric bicycle and offer a discount on the bicycle purchase price (section 6). The availability of income tax credits for the applicable income tax year is determined by which of these estimates results in the least amount of excess revenue. If the most recent quarterly June, September, or December revenue forecast, or the most recent interim revenue estimate, shows that: The bill also makes the family affordability tax credit nonrefundable beginning in income tax year 2025 (section 2). Lastly, the bill alters the following refundable income tax credits: The bill modifies the 3 income tax credits so that income tax year 2025 is the last tax year that each credit can be claimed as it currently exists and allows the department of revenue (department) to sell the income tax credits in state fiscal year 2025-26 to taxpayers who meet the existing eligibility requirements (qualified taxpayers). In state fiscal year 2025-26, the department is authorized to issue up to $40 million in income tax credit certificates to qualified taxpayers, subject to procedures established by the department. The proceeds of these sales are credited to the general fund. A qualified taxpayer may claim the full amount of tax credit against its income tax liability in income tax year 2030; except that the amount of the credit claimed cannot exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability for a given year. The unused amount of the credit carries forward and may be claimed in subsequent years; except that a credit cannot be carried over to any taxable year that begins after December 31, 2050. Page 3, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 3, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that: Page 3, Line 3(a)Â Â The Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) is a critical Page 3, Line 4constitutional safeguard that ensures Colorado taxpayers are protected Page 4, Line 1from excessive taxation and that government revenue remains within responsible limits; Page 4, Line 2(b)Â Â TABOR imposes strict limitations on the ability of the state Page 4, Line 3and local governments to raise taxes, requires voter approval for any new Page 4, Line 4tax or tax increase, and ensures that revenue is not collected in excess of the state's allowed cap; Page 4, Line 5(c)Â Â Colorado's government is committed to maintaining the Page 4, Line 6principles of fiscal responsibility and transparency, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently and effectively; Page 4, Line 7(d)Â Â Pausing tax credits is allowable up to the constitutional Page 4, Line 8mandated cap and may constitute a temporary reduction in expenditures Page 4, Line 9rather than an increase in taxes, as most tax credits are considered a form Page 4, Line 10of expenditure by the state, reducing the amount of tax revenue that would otherwise be collected; and Page 4, Line 11(e)Â Â Such a pause in tax credits does not increase the overall tax Page 4, Line 12burden on taxpayers and does not require voter approval under TABOR, Page 4, Line 13as it is consistent with the constitutional intent to limit state spending rather than to impose new taxes or tax increases. Page 4, Line 14(2)Â Â Therefore, the general assembly finds and declares that the Page 4, Line 15temporary suspension or reduction of tax credits is within the legal Page 4, Line 16authority of the general assembly and does not constitute a violation of Page 4, Line 17TABOR, as it represents a reduction in state expenditures rather than an increase in taxes.

Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Section 3 of the bill creates a mechanism for temporarily suspending or prorating all income tax credits, excluding the Colorado affordable housing tax credit and the earned income tax credits (income tax credits), based on estimates of the state's revenue. Beginning with the December 2025 quarterly revenue forecast, each quarterly revenue forecast in June, September, or December, and any interim revenue estimate given between quarterly forecasts, must include 2 estimates of the amount of excess state revenues in relation to the income tax credits available. Excess state revenues, for purposes of these estimates, means the total amount of revenue collected by the state during the state fiscal year in excess of the limitation on state fiscal year spending imposed by the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights that voters statewide have not authorized the state to retain and spend, less: The reimbursement to local governments to offset the reduction in property taxes resulting from property tax exemptions for qualifying seniors, veterans with disabilities, and spouses of veterans who died in the line of duty or as a result of a service-related injury or disease; the reimbursement to local governments to offset the reduction in property taxes resulting from the reduced valuation for assessment of qualified-senior primary residences; and any temporary income tax rate reduction in effect. These estimates are: An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins, assuming all income tax credits are available in the following income tax year; and An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins, assuming no income tax credits are available in the following income tax year. The estimate without income tax credits results in the least amount of excess revenue, then no income tax credits are available for the applicable income tax year; or The estimate with income tax credits results in the least amount of excess revenue, then all income tax credits are available for the applicable income tax year and are prorated so that the maximum total amount of each income tax credit claimed by all taxpayers claiming that credit does not exceed the amount equal to the estimated excess state revenues divided by the total number of income tax credits available during the applicable income tax year. The credit for the sale of new, electric-powered lawn equipment for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2027. Under existing law, this credit is allowed to qualified retailers who sell new, electric-powered lawn equipment and offer a discount on the purchase price (section 4); The credit for the installation of heat pump technology or a thermal energy network for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit is allowed to eligible taxpayers who meet certain industry criteria and install heat pump technology or a thermal energy network, if the eligible taxpayer provides a discount from the amount charged for installation (section 5); and The credit for the sale of new qualified electric bicycles for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit is allowed to qualified retailers who sell a qualified electric bicycle and offer a discount on the bicycle purchase price (section 6). The availability of income tax credits for the applicable income tax year is determined by which of these estimates results in the least amount of excess revenue. If the most recent quarterly June, September, or December revenue forecast, or the most recent interim revenue estimate, shows that: The bill also makes the family affordability tax credit nonrefundable beginning in income tax year 2025 (section 2). Lastly, the bill alters the following refundable income tax credits: The bill modifies the 3 income tax credits so that income tax year 2025 is the last tax year that each credit can be claimed as it currently exists and allows the department of revenue (department) to sell the income tax credits in state fiscal year 2025-26 to taxpayers who meet the existing eligibility requirements (qualified taxpayers). In state fiscal year 2025-26, the department is authorized to issue up to $40 million in income tax credit certificates to qualified taxpayers, subject to procedures established by the department. The proceeds of these sales are credited to the general fund. A qualified taxpayer may claim the full amount of tax credit against its income tax liability in income tax year 2030; except that the amount of the credit claimed cannot exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability for a given year. The unused amount of the credit carries forward and may be claimed in subsequent years; except that a credit cannot be carried over to any taxable year that begins after December 31, 2050. Page 3, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 3, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that: Page 3, Line 3(a)Â Â The Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) is a critical Page 3, Line 4constitutional safeguard that ensures Colorado taxpayers are protected Page 4, Line 1from excessive taxation and that government revenue remains within responsible limits; Page 4, Line 2(b)Â Â TABOR imposes strict limitations on the ability of the state Page 4, Line 3and local governments to raise taxes, requires voter approval for any new Page 4, Line 4tax or tax increase, and ensures that revenue is not collected in excess of the state's allowed cap; Page 4, Line 5(c)Â Â Colorado's government is committed to maintaining the Page 4, Line 6principles of fiscal responsibility and transparency, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently and effectively; Page 4, Line 7(d)Â Â Pausing tax credits is allowable up to the constitutional Page 4, Line 8mandated cap and may constitute a temporary reduction in expenditures Page 4, Line 9rather than an increase in taxes, as most tax credits are considered a form Page 4, Line 10of expenditure by the state, reducing the amount of tax revenue that would otherwise be collected; and Page 4, Line 11(e)Â Â Such a pause in tax credits does not increase the overall tax Page 4, Line 12burden on taxpayers and does not require voter approval under TABOR, Page 4, Line 13as it is consistent with the constitutional intent to limit state spending rather than to impose new taxes or tax increases. Page 4, Line 14(2)Â Â Therefore, the general assembly finds and declares that the Page 4, Line 15temporary suspension or reduction of tax credits is within the legal Page 4, Line 16authority of the general assembly and does not constitute a violation of Page 4, Line 17TABOR, as it represents a reduction in state expenditures rather than an increase in taxes. Page 4, Line 18SECTIONÂ 2.Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, 39-22-130, amend (10) as follows: Page 4, Line 1939-22-130.Â Â Family affordability tax credit - tax preference Page 4, Line 20performance statement - legislative declaration - definitions - repeal.

Page 7, Line 9(3)Â Â Notwithstanding any provision of law to the Page 7, Line 10contrary, the availability of income tax credits for the Page 7, Line 11applicable income tax year is determined by which income tax Page 7, Line 12credit estimate required by subsection (2) of this section results Page 7, Line 13in the least amount of excess state revenue. If the most recent Page 7, Line 14quarterly June, September, or December revenue forecast, as Page 7, Line 15prepared by the legislative council staff and the office of state Page 7, Line 16planning and budgeting, or the most recent interim revenue estimate, shows that: Page 7, Line 17(a)Â Â The state revenue estimate without income tax credits Page 7, Line 18results in the least amount of excess state revenue of the Page 7, Line 19income tax credit estimates, then no income tax credits are available for the applicable income tax year; or Page 7, Line 20(b)Â Â The state revenue estimate with full income tax Page 7, Line 21credits results in the least amount of excess state revenue of Page 7, Line 22the income tax credit estimates, then all income tax credits are Page 8, Line 1available for the applicable income tax year and are prorated Page 8, Line 2so that the maximum total amount of each income tax credit Page 8, Line 3claimed by all taxpayers claiming that credit does not exceed Page 8, Line 4the amount equal to the estimated excess state revenue divided Page 8, Line 5by the total number of income tax credits available during the applicable income tax year or the amount.
