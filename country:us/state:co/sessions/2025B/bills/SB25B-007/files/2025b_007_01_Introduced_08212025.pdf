including low-income pregnant and postpartum people and children in
low-income families, whose immigration status would otherwise make
them ineligible for coverage under state-federal programs or would limit
the coverage's scope or duration. Other expansions make state-subsidized
individual health insurance coverage available for certain people,
regardless of immigration status. The bill modifies several provisions
related to these coverage expansions by:
! Prohibiting the department of health care policy and
financing (HCPF) from reimbursing a health-care provider,
entity, or facility for providing medical services to a person
who is not a lawful resident;
! Eliminating full health insurance coverage for pregnant and
postpartum people who would be eligible for medicaid or
the children's basic health plan if not for their immigration
status;
! Eliminating full health insurance coverage for children who
would be eligible for medicaid or the children's basic health
plan if not for their immigration status;
! Repealing the state reproductive health-care program, the
medical assistance program, and the state children's basic
health plan (state-funded programs) that were established
to provide expanded coverage;
! Halting outreach to and enrollment of eligible groups into
new coverage options;
! Removing HCPF's potential to spend in excess of an
authorized amount for the state-funded programs; and
! Excluding immigrants who are not lawfully residing in the
state from state-subsidized individual health insurance
coverage available through the health insurance
affordability enterprise.
