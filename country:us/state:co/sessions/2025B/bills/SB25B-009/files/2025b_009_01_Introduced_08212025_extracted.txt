suspending or prorating all income tax credits, excluding the Colorado
affordable housing tax credit and the earned income tax credits (income
tax credits), based on estimates of the state's revenue. Beginning with the
December 2025 quarterly revenue forecast, each quarterly revenue
forecast in June, September, or December, and any interim revenue
estimate given between quarterly forecasts, must include 2 estimates of
the amount of excess state revenues in relation to the income tax credits
available. Excess state revenues, for purposes of these estimates, means
the total amount of revenue collected by the state during the state fiscal
year in excess of the limitation on state fiscal year spending imposed by
the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights that voters statewide have not authorized the
state to retain and spend, less: The reimbursement to local governments
to offset the reduction in property taxes resulting from property tax
exemptions for qualifying seniors, veterans with disabilities, and spouses
of veterans who died in the line of duty or as a result of a service-related
injury or disease; the reimbursement to local governments to offset the
reduction in property taxes resulting from the reduced valuation for
assessment of qualified-senior primary residences; and any temporary
income tax rate reduction in effect. These estimates are:
! An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the
state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins,
assuming all income tax credits are available in the
following income tax year; and
! An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the
state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins,
assuming no income tax credits are available in the
following income tax year.
The availability of income tax credits for the applicable income tax year
is determined by which of these estimates results in the least amount of
excess revenue. If the most recent quarterly June, September, or
December revenue forecast, or the most recent interim revenue estimate,
shows that:
! The estimate without income tax credits results in the least
amount of excess revenue, then no income tax credits are
available for the applicable income tax year; or
! The estimate with income tax credits results in the least
amount of excess revenue, then all income tax credits are
available for the applicable income tax year and are
prorated so that the maximum total amount of each income
tax credit claimed by all taxpayers claiming that credit does
not exceed the amount equal to the estimated excess state
revenues divided by the total number of income tax credits
available during the applicable income tax year.
The bill also makes the family affordability tax credit
nonrefundable beginning in income tax year 2025 (section 2).
-2- SB25B-009
Lastly, the bill alters the following refundable income tax credits:
! The credit for the sale of new, electric-powered lawn
equipment for income tax years commencing on or after
January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2027. Under existing
law, this credit is allowed to qualified retailers who sell
new, electric-powered lawn equipment and offer a discount
on the purchase price (section 4);
! The credit for the installation of heat pump technology or
a thermal energy network for income tax years
commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before
January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit is allowed
to eligible taxpayers who meet certain industry criteria and
install heat pump technology or a thermal energy network,
if the eligible taxpayer provides a discount from the amount
charged for installation (section 5); and
! The credit for the sale of new qualified electric bicycles for
income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024,
but before January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit
is allowed to qualified retailers who sell a qualified electric
bicycle and offer a discount on the bicycle purchase price
(section 6).
The bill modifies the 3 income tax credits so that income tax year 2025
is the last tax year that each credit can be claimed as it currently exists
and allows the department of revenue (department) to sell the income tax
credits in state fiscal year 2025-26 to taxpayers who meet the existing
eligibility requirements (qualified taxpayers). In state fiscal year 2025-26,
the department is authorized to issue up to $40 million in income tax
credit certificates to qualified taxpayers, subject to procedures established
by the department. The proceeds of these sales are credited to the general
fund. A qualified taxpayer may claim the full amount of tax credit against
its income tax liability in income tax year 2030; except that the amount
of the credit claimed cannot exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability for
a given year. The unused amount of the credit carries forward and may be
claimed in subsequent years; except that a credit cannot be carried over
to any taxable year that begins after December 31, 2050.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) The Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) is a critical
5 constitutional safeguard that ensures Colorado taxpayers are protected
-3- SB25B-009
1 from excessive taxation and that government revenue remains within
2 responsible limits;
3 (b) TABOR imposes strict limitations on the ability of the state
4 and local governments to raise taxes, requires voter approval for any new
5 tax or tax increase, and ensures that revenue is not collected in excess of
6 the state's allowed cap;
7 (c) Colorado's government is committed to maintaining the
8 principles of fiscal responsibility and transparency, ensuring that taxpayer
9 dollars are spent efficiently and effectively;
10 (d) Pausing tax credits is allowable up to the constitutional
11 mandated cap and may constitute a temporary reduction in expenditures
12 rather than an increase in taxes, as most tax credits are considered a form
13 of expenditure by the state, reducing the amount of tax revenue that
14 would otherwise be collected; and
15 (e) Such a pause in tax credits does not increase the overall tax
16 burden on taxpayers and does not require voter approval under TABOR,
17 as it is consistent with the constitutional intent to limit state spending
18 rather than to impose new taxes or tax increases.
19 (2) Therefore, the general assembly finds and declares that the
20 temporary suspension or reduction of tax credits is within the legal
21 authority of the general assembly and does not constitute a violation of
22 TABOR, as it represents a reduction in state expenditures rather than an
23 increase in taxes.

First Extraordinary Session
Seventy-fifth General Assembly
STATE OF COLORADO
INTRODUCED

State, Veterans, & Military Affairs
A BILL FOR AN ACT
101 CONCERNING THE ADJUSTMENT OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX CREDITS,
102 AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AUTHORIZING THE
103 DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE TO SELL CERTAIN INCOME TAX
104 CREDITS TO QUALIFIED TAXPAYERS AND TEMPORARILY
105 SUSPENDING OR PRORATING INCOME TAX CREDITS BASED ON
106 REVENUE ESTIMATES.
Bill Summary
(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does
not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill
passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that
applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at
http://leg.colorado.gov.)
Section 3 of the bill creates a mechanism for temporarily
Shading denotes HOUSE amendment. Double underlining denotes SENATE amendment.
Capital letters or bold & italic numbers indicate new material to be added to existing law.
Dashes through the words or numbers indicate deletions from existing law.

suspending or prorating all income tax credits, excluding the Colorado
affordable housing tax credit and the earned income tax credits (income
tax credits), based on estimates of the state's revenue. Beginning with the
December 2025 quarterly revenue forecast, each quarterly revenue
forecast in June, September, or December, and any interim revenue
estimate given between quarterly forecasts, must include 2 estimates of
the amount of excess state revenues in relation to the income tax credits
available. Excess state revenues, for purposes of these estimates, means
the total amount of revenue collected by the state during the state fiscal
year in excess of the limitation on state fiscal year spending imposed by
the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights that voters statewide have not authorized the
state to retain and spend, less: The reimbursement to local governments
to offset the reduction in property taxes resulting from property tax
exemptions for qualifying seniors, veterans with disabilities, and spouses
of veterans who died in the line of duty or as a result of a service-related
injury or disease; the reimbursement to local governments to offset the
reduction in property taxes resulting from the reduced valuation for
assessment of qualified-senior primary residences; and any temporary
income tax rate reduction in effect. These estimates are:
! An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the
state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins,
assuming all income tax credits are available in the
following income tax year; and
! An estimate of the amount of excess state revenues in the
state fiscal year during which the income tax year begins,
assuming no income tax credits are available in the
following income tax year.
The availability of income tax credits for the applicable income tax year
is determined by which of these estimates results in the least amount of
excess revenue. If the most recent quarterly June, September, or
December revenue forecast, or the most recent interim revenue estimate,
shows that:
! The estimate without income tax credits results in the least
amount of excess revenue, then no income tax credits are
available for the applicable income tax year; or
! The estimate with income tax credits results in the least
amount of excess revenue, then all income tax credits are
available for the applicable income tax year and are
prorated so that the maximum total amount of each income
tax credit claimed by all taxpayers claiming that credit does
not exceed the amount equal to the estimated excess state
revenues divided by the total number of income tax credits
available during the applicable income tax year.
The bill also makes the family affordability tax credit
nonrefundable beginning in income tax year 2025 (section 2).
-2- SB25B-009

Lastly, the bill alters the following refundable income tax credits:
! The credit for the sale of new, electric-powered lawn
equipment for income tax years commencing on or after
January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2027. Under existing
law, this credit is allowed to qualified retailers who sell
new, electric-powered lawn equipment and offer a discount
on the purchase price (section 4);
! The credit for the installation of heat pump technology or
a thermal energy network for income tax years
commencing on or after January 1, 2024, but before
January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit is allowed
to eligible taxpayers who meet certain industry criteria and
install heat pump technology or a thermal energy network,
if the eligible taxpayer provides a discount from the amount
charged for installation (section 5); and
! The credit for the sale of new qualified electric bicycles for
income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2024,
but before January 1, 2033. Under existing law, this credit
is allowed to qualified retailers who sell a qualified electric
bicycle and offer a discount on the bicycle purchase price
(section 6).
The bill modifies the 3 income tax credits so that income tax year 2025
is the last tax year that each credit can be claimed as it currently exists
and allows the department of revenue (department) to sell the income tax
credits in state fiscal year 2025-26 to taxpayers who meet the existing
eligibility requirements (qualified taxpayers). In state fiscal year 2025-26,
the department is authorized to issue up to $40 million in income tax
credit certificates to qualified taxpayers, subject to procedures established
by the department. The proceeds of these sales are credited to the general
fund. A qualified taxpayer may claim the full amount of tax credit against
its income tax liability in income tax year 2030; except that the amount
of the credit claimed cannot exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability for
a given year. The unused amount of the credit carries forward and may be
claimed in subsequent years; except that a credit cannot be carried over
to any taxable year that begins after December 31, 2050.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) The Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) is a critical
5 constitutional safeguard that ensures Colorado taxpayers are protected
-3- SB25B-009

1 from excessive taxation and that government revenue remains within
2 responsible limits;
3 (b) TABOR imposes strict limitations on the ability of the state
4 and local governments to raise taxes, requires voter approval for any new
5 tax or tax increase, and ensures that revenue is not collected in excess of
6 the state's allowed cap;
7 (c) Colorado's government is committed to maintaining the
8 principles of fiscal responsibility and transparency, ensuring that taxpayer
9 dollars are spent efficiently and effectively;
10 (d) Pausing tax credits is allowable up to the constitutional
11 mandated cap and may constitute a temporary reduction in expenditures
12 rather than an increase in taxes, as most tax credits are considered a form
13 of expenditure by the state, reducing the amount of tax revenue that
14 would otherwise be collected; and
15 (e) Such a pause in tax credits does not increase the overall tax
16 burden on taxpayers and does not require voter approval under TABOR,
17 as it is consistent with the constitutional intent to limit state spending
18 rather than to impose new taxes or tax increases.
19 (2) Therefore, the general assembly finds and declares that the
20 temporary suspension or reduction of tax credits is within the legal
21 authority of the general assembly and does not constitute a violation of
22 TABOR, as it represents a reduction in state expenditures rather than an
23 increase in taxes.
24 SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 39-22-130, amend
25 (10) as follows:
26 39-22-130. Family affordability tax credit - tax preference

4 income taxes due is refunded to the individual.
5 (II) THIS SUBSECTION (10)(a) IS REPEALED, EFFECTIVE JANUARY
6 1, 2027.
7 (b) FOR INCOME TAX YEARS COMMENCING ON OR AFTER JANUARY
8 1, 2025, BUT BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2034, THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT
9 ALLOWED UNDER THIS SECTION THAT EXCEEDS THE RESIDENT
10 INDIVIDUAL'S INCOME TAXES DUE IS NOT REFUNDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

22 REVENUE COLLECTED BY THE STATE DURING THE STATE FISCAL YEAR IN
23 EXCESS OF THE LIMITATION ON STATE FISCAL YEAR SPENDING IMPOSED BY

9 (b) THE GOVERNOR SHALL INCLUDE IN EACH INTERIM REVENUE
10 ESTIMATE A STATE REVENUE ESTIMATE WITH COMPLETE INCOME TAX
11 CREDITS AND A STATE REVENUE ESTIMATE WITHOUT INCOME TAX CREDITS.
12 (3) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE

14 APPLICABLE INCOME TAX YEAR IS DETERMINED BY WHICH INCOME TAX
15 CREDIT ESTIMATE REQUIRED BY SUBSECTION (2) OF THIS SECTION RESULTS
16 IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EXCESS STATE REVENUE. IF THE MOST RECENT
17 QUARTERLY JUNE, SEPTEMBER, OR DECEMBER REVENUE FORECAST, AS
18 PREPARED BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL STAFF AND THE OFFICE OF STATE

20 ESTIMATE, SHOWS THAT:
