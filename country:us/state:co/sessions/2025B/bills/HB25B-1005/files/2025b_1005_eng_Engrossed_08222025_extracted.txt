expenses incurred in collecting and remitting state sales tax.
Beginning January 1, 2026, the bill eliminates the sales tax vendor
fee that retailers are authorized to retain in connection with collecting and
remitting state sales tax.
The bill also makes conforming amendments to prevent additional
sales tax revenue from being included in the calculation of state sales tax
increment revenue for purposes of the "Colorado Regional Tourism Act"
and to maintain the amount of sales and use tax revenue that the state
treasurer annually credits to the housing development grant fund.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) The vendor fee in section 39-26-105, Colorado Revised
5 Statutes, was designed to reimburse retailers for a specific service
6 performed on behalf of the state: The collection and remittance of
7 state-collected sales tax revenue;
8 (b) Not all retailers are equally compensated for their services.
9 Only retailers that have total taxable sales of $1 million or less for the
10 filing period are able to collect the vendor fee, and most of Colorado's
11 home rule cities do not pay similar vendor fees for the collection and
12 remittance of local sales tax. In addition, not all state taxes have vendor
13 fees.
14 (c) The vendor fee is being removed to promote fairness and
15 equality between all retailers by ending this benefit that some retailers
16 receive and others do not receive. Further, the vendor fee is being
17 removed to simplify the collection of state-collected sales tax, ease
18 administrative burden, and relieve retailer confusion. Any revenue gain
19 caused by the removal of the vendor fee is incidental to the primary
20 purposes of promoting fairness and equality, simplifying the collection of
-2- 1005
1 state-collected sales tax, easing administrative burdens, and relieving
2 retailer confusion.
3 (d) Any revenue gain caused by the removal of the vendor fee is
4 de minimis.
5 (2) The general assembly further finds and declares that:
6 (a) Removal of the vendor fee is not a tax policy change for
7 purposes of section 20 (4)(a) of article X of the Colorado constitution
8 because it does not in any way affect the amount of sales tax imposed on
9 and paid by taxpayers but instead only distributes a small portion of gross
10 sales tax revenue collected to vendors for their collection and remittance
11 of state-collected sales tax revenue;
12 (b) Further, even if removal of the vendor fee could be considered
13 a tax policy change, consistent with the Colorado Supreme Court's
14 holding in TABOR Found. v. Reg'l Transp. Dist., 2018 CO 29, that
15 legislation that causes only an incidental and de minimis tax revenue
16 increase does not amount to a new tax or a tax policy change that requires
17 advance voter approval under section 20 of article X of the Colorado
18 constitution, the removal of the vendor fee is neither a new tax nor a tax
19 policy change that requires voter approval; and
20 (c) The removal of the vendor fee does not create new
21 responsibilities or burdens on retailers. Instead, the removal of the fee
22 demonstrates the general assembly's intent that the collection of sales tax
23 revenue be fair and equal throughout the state, and that the burdens of
24 doing so are limited, fair, and equal throughout the state.
25 SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 39-26-105, amend
26 (1)(c), (1)(d)(I), and (5)(c); and add (1)(d)(V) as follows:
27 39-26-105. Vendor liable for tax - definitions - repeal.
-3- 1005

4 director of the department of revenue, less an amount as set forth in
5 subsection (1)(c)(II) or (1)(d) of this section to cover the retailer's expense
6 in the collection and remittance of said tax.
7 (II) For sales made prior to January 1, 2020, the amount retained
8 by a retailer to cover the retailer's expense in collecting and remitting tax
9 pursuant to this section is three and one-third percent of all sales tax
10 reported.
11 (III) If any retailer is delinquent in remitting said tax, other than
12 in unusual circumstances shown to the satisfaction of the executive
13 director of the department of revenue, the retailer shall not be allowed to
14 retain any amounts under this subsection (1)(c) or subsection (1)(d) of this
15 section to cover such retailer's expense in collecting and remitting said
16 tax, and an amount equivalent to the said percentage, plus the amount of
17 any local vendor expense that may be allowed by the local government to
18 the vendor, shall be remitted to the executive director by any such
19 delinquent vendor. Any local vendor expense remitted to the executive
20 director shall be deposited to the state general fund.
21 (d) (I) (A) For sales made on or after January 1, 2020, except as
22 provided in subsection (1)(d)(I)(B) of this section BUT BEFORE JANUARY
23 1, 2026, the amount retained by a retailer to cover the retailer's expense
24 in collecting and remitting tax in accordance with this section is four
25 percent of the tax reported; except that a retailer shall not retain more than
26 one thousand dollars in any filing period.
27 (B) For sales made on and after January 1, 2023, but before

2 expense in collecting and remitting tax in accordance with this section for
3 any filing period that the retailer's total taxable sales are less than or equal
4 to one hundred thousand dollars is five and three-tenths percent of the tax
5 reported; except that a retailer should not retain more than one thousand
6 dollars in any filing period. This subsection (1)(d)(I)(B) is repealed,
7 effective January 1, 2032.
8 (V) BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2026, A RETAILER IS NOT PERMITTED
9 TO RETAIN ANY MONEY TO COVER THE RETAILER'S EXPENSES IN
10 COLLECTING AND REMITTING STATE TAX IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
11 SECTION REGARDLESS OF THE RETAILER'S TOTAL TAXABLE SALES FOR ANY
12 FILING PERIOD.
13 (5) (c) From the amount of the tax required to be remitted
14 pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section, a qualified purchaser shall
15 be entitled to retain the amount specified in subsection (1)(c)(II) or (1)(d)
16 of this section that a retailer would otherwise be entitled to retain to cover
17 the retailer's expense in collecting and remitting the tax imposed by this
18 article 26 if the qualified purchaser had not provided a direct payment
19 permit number to the retailer.

27 zone in excess of the amount of base year revenue. "State sales tax

1 increment revenue" does not include any additional revenue derived from
2 state sales taxes that are due to the changes set forth in section 39-26-105
3 (1)(d), enacted in 2019 AND AS AMENDED THEREAFTER, to the amount
4 retained by a vendor to cover the vendor's expenses in collecting and
5 remitting sales tax.
6 SECTION 4. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 39-26-123, amend
7 (3)(b)(I); and add (3)(b)(III) as follows:

10 state fiscal year commencing on or after July 1, 2013, the state treasurer
11 shall credit eighty-five percent of all net revenue collected under this
12 article 26 to the old age pension fund created in section 1 of article XXIV
