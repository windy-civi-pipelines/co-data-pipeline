department of revenue the sales tax revenue that it collects and allows
some retailers to retain a sales tax vendor fee to cover the retailer's
expenses incurred in collecting and remitting state sales tax.
Beginning January 1, 2026, the bill eliminates the sales tax vendor

fee that retailers are authorized to retain in connection with collecting and
remitting state sales tax.
The bill also makes conforming amendments to prevent additional
sales tax revenue from being included in the calculation of state sales tax
increment revenue for purposes of the "Colorado Regional Tourism Act"
and to maintain the amount of sales and use tax revenue that the state
treasurer annually credits to the housing development grant fund.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) The vendor fee in section 39-26-105, Colorado Revised
5 Statutes, was designed to reimburse retailers for a specific service
6 performed on behalf of the state: The collection and remittance of
7 state-collected sales tax revenue;
8 (b) Not all retailers are equally compensated for their services.
9 Only retailers that have total taxable sales of $1 million or less for the
10 filing period are able to collect the vendor fee, and most of Colorado's
11 home rule cities do not pay similar vendor fees for the collection and
12 remittance of local sales tax. In addition, not all state taxes have vendor
13 fees.
14 (c) The vendor fee is being removed to promote fairness and
15 equality between all retailers by ending this benefit that some retailers
16 receive and others do not receive. Further, the vendor fee is being
17 removed to simplify the collection of state-collected sales tax, ease
18 administrative burden, and relieve retailer confusion. Any revenue gain
19 caused by the removal of the vendor fee is incidental to the primary
20 purposes of promoting fairness and equality, simplifying the collection of
21 state-collected sales tax, easing administrative burdens, and relieving
22 retailer confusion.
-2- HB25B-1005

1 (d) Any revenue gain caused by the removal of the vendor fee is
2 de minimis.
3 (2) The general assembly further finds and declares that:
4 (a) Removal of the vendor fee is not a tax policy change for
5 purposes of section 20 (4)(a) of article X of the Colorado constitution
6 because it does not in any way affect the amount of sales tax imposed on
7 and paid by taxpayers but instead only distributes a small portion of gross
8 sales tax revenue collected to vendors for their collection and remittance
9 of state-collected sales tax revenue;
10 (b) Further, even if removal of the vendor fee could be considered
11 a tax policy change, consistent with the Colorado Supreme Court's
12 holding in TABOR Found. v. Reg'l Transp. Dist., 2018 CO 29, that
13 legislation that causes only an incidental and de minimis tax revenue
14 increase does not amount to a new tax or a tax policy change that requires
15 advance voter approval under section 20 of article X of the Colorado
16 constitution, the removal of the vendor fee is neither a new tax nor a tax
17 policy change that requires voter approval; and
18 (c) The removal of the vendor fee does not create new
19 responsibilities or burdens on retailers. Instead, the removal of the fee
20 demonstrates the general assembly's intent that the collection of sales tax
21 revenue be fair and equal throughout the state, and that the burdens of
22 doing so are limited, fair, and equal throughout the state.
23 SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 39-26-105, amend
24 (1)(c), (1)(d)(I), and (5)(c); and add (1)(d)(V) as follows:

6 by a retailer to cover the retailer's expense in collecting and remitting tax

8 reported.
9 (III) If any retailer is delinquent in remitting said tax, other than

12 retain any amounts under this subsection (1)(c) or subsection (1)(d) of this
