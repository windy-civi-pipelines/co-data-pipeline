The bill prohibits the department of health care policy and
financing (HCPF) from reimbursing a:
! Health-care provider who, or entity or facility that,
performs, assists in the performance of, or refers a person
to abortion or gender-affirming health-care services; or
! A health-care provider, entity, or facility for providing
medical services to a person who does not satisfy
citizenship or residency requirements.
The bill makes related conforming amendments.
Under current law, HCPF administers the reproductive health-care
program, the state medical assistance program, and the state children's
basic health plan (collectively, "the programs") to certain individuals who
are ineligible for the programs due to their immigration status. The bill
repeals the programs and makes related conforming amendments.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds that:
4 (a) In order to preserve access to the state's medicaid health
5 services, Colorado must prioritize essential health-care coverage for the
6 most vulnerable populations in the state;
7 (b) Low-income children and families, the elderly, and individuals
8 with disabilities rely on medicaid as an essential service that is a lifeline;
9 (c) In pursuit of sustaining long-term funding for the state's
10 medicaid health services for Colorado citizens, the state must correctly
11 allocate funding to essential health services that have a direct impact on
12 Colorado citizens' health;
13 (d) Health first Colorado, Colorado's medicaid program, should
14 not cover elective procedures. It should only cover procedures that are
15 medically necessary for Colorado citizens.
16 (e) Previously, due to insufficient data, the state was unable to
-2- HB25B-1015

1 accurately estimate the costs of Cover All Coloradans, OmniSalud,
2 abortion, and gender mutilation. These fiscal impacts have led to a large
3 discrepancy between the estimated costs and the true impact on health
4 coverage for Colorado citizens.
5 (f) Now, it is estimated that the state has spent $51 million on
6 Cover All Coloradans, $90 million on OmniSalud, $6 million on
7 abortions, and $4.5 million on gender mutilation, totaling over $150
8 million that could otherwise be spent on Colorado citizens;
9 (g) While over $150 million is spent on elective procedures for
10 individuals and health-care coverage for undocumented individuals,
11 Colorado is anticipating a 28% increase in premiums in 2026; and
12 (h) Although Amendment 79 permits the use of public funds for
13 abortion, it does not explicitly require public funds to be used for
14 abortion.
15 (2) Therefore, the general assembly declares that state medicaid
16 funding must not be used for abortion or gender mutilation for an
17 individual, or health services for an undocumented individual. These
18 limitations will protect Colorado's commitment to prioritizing and
19 protecting essential health-care coverage for the most vulnerable
20 populations in the state and supporting the ethical use of taxpayer dollars
21 that align with the state's core values.
22 SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 25.5-4-415.5 as
23 follows:
24 25.5-4-415.5. Prohibition on reimbursement for abortion or

18 FOR A PERSON WHO IS UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE IF THE PERSON'S
