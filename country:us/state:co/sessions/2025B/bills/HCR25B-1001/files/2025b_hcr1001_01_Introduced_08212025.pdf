The concurrent resolution refers to the voters of the state at the
2026 general election a constitutional amendment to require voter
approval in advance for any change to state law that would reduce the
vendor fee allowed to retailers that collect state sales tax.
1 WHEREAS, The clauses appearing before Section 1 of this
2 measure express the intent of the general assembly in adopting the
3 measure and are intended to be included as part of the text of the measure
4 for purposes of publication pursuant to section 1-40-124, Colorado
5 Revised Statutes, and the ballot information booklet pursuant to section
6 1 (7.5) of article V of the state constitution and section 1-40-124.5,
7 Colorado Revised Statutes; and
8 WHEREAS, Colorado's small retailers are essential to the health
9 of our economy and the strength of our communities, and these
10 businesses serve as employers, community partners, and local anchors,
11 while also collecting and remitting sales taxes on behalf of the state-a
12 responsibility that comes with both time and cost; and
13 WHEREAS, The vendor fee was established to recognize this
14 work and to help offset the administrative burden placed on retailers, and
15 it has long been a stable and predictable form of relief for small
16 businesses facing the pressures of regulation, inflation, and changing
17 market conditions; and
18 WHEREAS, Reductions to the vendor fee, without the consent of
19 the people, would impose an additional cost on small retailers, effectively
20 increasing the amount of state revenue collected from them without voter
21 approval, and the Colorado constitution, through the Taxpayer's Bill of
22 Rights, ensures that Coloradans have the final say on new or increased
-2- HCR25B-1001

1 taxes; and
2 WHEREAS, It is the intent of the general assembly to protect
3 small retailers and preserve the spirit of taxpayer consent by requiring that
4 any reduction in the vendor fee be approved by Colorado voters, and this
5 safeguard will ensure that changes affecting thousands of small
6 businesses across the state are made only with the approval of the people
7 they serve; now, therefore,
8 Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-fifth
9 General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate concurring herein:

27 fiscal years before a suit is filed shall be refunded with 10% annual
