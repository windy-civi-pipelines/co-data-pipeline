Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) The bill establishes that the use of artificial intelligence systems or required disclosure artificial intelligence systems (artificial intelligence systems) must comply with the "Colorado Consumer Protection Act". The attorney general may bring a claim against a developer or a deployer that uses an artificial intelligence system in a way that violates the "Colorado Consumer Protection Act". A developer or a deployer of an artificial intelligence system must disclose to a consumer when the consumer is interacting with the artificial intelligence system and not with a human in certain circumstances. The bill establishes certain requirements for claims brought by the attorney general and parameters for court orders resulting from those claims. The attorney general may adopt rules for the implementation and enforcement of this provision of the bill. A developer of an artificial intelligence system is also subject to the provisions of the "Colorado Anti-discrimination Act" if the artificial intelligence system is deployed in a way that violates the "Colorado Anti-discrimination Act". An individual may file a complaint with the Colorado civil rights division against the developer if the developer's artificial intelligence system discriminates against the individual in certain circumstances. The bill requires that contracts entered into by a Colorado public school, a state agency, or other public entity comply with the provisions of the "Colorado Consumer Protection Act" or the "Colorado Anti-discrimination Act" in relation to the use and deployment of artificial intelligence systems and that a contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless a state agency or public entity.
