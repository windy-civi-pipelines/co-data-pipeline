Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Current law extends health insurance coverage to various people, including low-income pregnant and postpartum people and children in low-income families, whose immigration status would otherwise make them ineligible for coverage under state-federal programs or would limit the coverage's scope or duration. Other expansions make state-subsidized individual health insurance coverage available for certain people, regardless of immigration status. The bill modifies several provisions related to these coverage expansions by: Prohibiting the department of health care policy and financing (HCPF) from reimbursing a health-care provider, entity, or facility for providing medical services to a person who is not a lawful resident; Eliminating full health insurance coverage for pregnant and postpartum people who would be eligible for medicaid or the children's basic health plan if not for their immigration status; Eliminating full health insurance coverage for children who would be eligible for medicaid or the children's basic health plan if not for their immigration status; Repealing the state reproductive health-care program, the medical assistance program, and the state children's basic health plan (state-funded programs) that were established to provide expanded coverage; Halting outreach to and enrollment of eligible groups into new coverage options; Removing HCPF's potential to spend in excess of an authorized amount for the state-funded programs; and Excluding immigrants who are not lawfully residing in the state from state-subsidized individual health insurance coverage available through the health insurance affordability enterprise.

Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Current law extends health insurance coverage to various people, including low-income pregnant and postpartum people and children in low-income families, whose immigration status would otherwise make them ineligible for coverage under state-federal programs or would limit the coverage's scope or duration. Other expansions make state-subsidized individual health insurance coverage available for certain people, regardless of immigration status. The bill modifies several provisions related to these coverage expansions by: Prohibiting the department of health care policy and financing (HCPF) from reimbursing a health-care provider, entity, or facility for providing medical services to a person who is not a lawful resident; Eliminating full health insurance coverage for pregnant and postpartum people who would be eligible for medicaid or the children's basic health plan if not for their immigration status; Eliminating full health insurance coverage for children who would be eligible for medicaid or the children's basic health plan if not for their immigration status; Repealing the state reproductive health-care program, the medical assistance program, and the state children's basic health plan (state-funded programs) that were established to provide expanded coverage; Halting outreach to and enrollment of eligible groups into new coverage options; Removing HCPF's potential to spend in excess of an authorized amount for the state-funded programs; and Excluding immigrants who are not lawfully residing in the state from state-subsidized individual health insurance coverage available through the health insurance affordability enterprise.
