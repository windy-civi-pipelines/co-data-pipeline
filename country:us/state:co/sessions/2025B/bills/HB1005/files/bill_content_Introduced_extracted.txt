Bill Summary (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Current law requires a retailer to periodically remit to the department of revenue the sales tax revenue that it collects and allows some retailers to retain a sales tax vendor fee to cover the retailer's expenses incurred in collecting and remitting state sales tax. Beginning January 1, 2026, the bill eliminates the sales tax vendor fee that retailers are authorized to retain in connection with collecting and remitting state sales tax. The bill also makes conforming amendments to prevent additional sales tax revenue from being included in the calculation of state sales tax increment revenue for purposes of the "Colorado Regional Tourism Act" and to maintain the amount of sales and use tax revenue that the state treasurer annually credits to the housing development grant fund. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that: Page 2, Line 3(a)Â Â The vendor fee in section 39-26-105, Colorado Revised Page 2, Line 4Statutes, was designed to reimburse retailers for a specific service Page 2, Line 5performed on behalf of the state: The collection and remittance of state-collected sales tax revenue; Page 2, Line 6(b)Â Â Not all retailers are equally compensated for their services. Page 2, Line 7Only retailers that have total taxable sales of $1 million or less for the Page 2, Line 8filing period are able to collect the vendor fee, and most of Colorado's Page 2, Line 9home rule cities do not pay similar vendor fees for the collection and Page 2, Line 10remittance of local sales tax. In addition, not all state taxes have vendor fees. Page 2, Line 11(c)Â Â The vendor fee is being removed to promote fairness and Page 2, Line 12equality between all retailers by ending this benefit that some retailers Page 2, Line 13receive and others do not receive. Further, the vendor fee is being Page 2, Line 14removed to simplify the collection of state-collected sales tax, ease Page 2, Line 15administrative burden, and relieve retailer confusion. Any revenue gain Page 2, Line 16caused by the removal of the vendor fee is incidental to the primary Page 2, Line 17purposes of promoting fairness and equality, simplifying the collection of Page 2, Line 18state-collected sales tax, easing administrative burdens, and relieving Page 2, Line 19retailer confusion. Page 3, Line 1(d)Â Â Any revenue gain caused by the removal of the vendor fee is de minimis. Page 3, Line 2(2)Â Â The general assembly further finds and declares that: Page 3, Line 3(a)Â Â Removal of the vendor fee is not a tax policy change for Page 3, Line 4purposes of section 20 (4)(a) of article X of the Colorado constitution Page 3, Line 5because it does not in any way affect the amount of sales tax imposed on Page 3, Line 6and paid by taxpayers but instead only distributes a small portion of gross Page 3, Line 7sales tax revenue collected to vendors for their collection and remittance of state-collected sales tax revenue; Page 3, Line 8(b)Â Â Further, even if removal of the vendor fee could be considered Page 3, Line 9a tax policy change, consistent with the Colorado Supreme Court's Page 3, Line 10holding in TABOR Found. v. Reg'l Transp. Dist., 2018 CO 29, that Page 3, Line 11legislation that causes only an incidental and de minimis tax revenue Page 3, Line 12increase does not amount to a new tax or a tax policy change that requires Page 3, Line 13advance voter approval under section 20 of article X of the Colorado Page 3, Line 14constitution, the removal of the vendor fee is neither a new tax nor a tax policy change that requires voter approval; and Page 3, Line 15(c)Â Â The removal of the vendor fee does not create new Page 3, Line 16responsibilities or burdens on retailers. Instead, the removal of the fee Page 3, Line 17demonstrates the general assembly's intent that the collection of sales tax Page 3, Line 18revenue be fair and equal throughout the state, and that the burdens of doing so are limited, fair, and equal throughout the state.
