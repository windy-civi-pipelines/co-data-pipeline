If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.) Current law requires a retailer to periodically remit to the department of revenue the sales tax revenue that it collects and allows some retailers to retain a sales tax vendor fee to cover the retailer's expenses incurred in collecting and remitting state sales tax. Beginning January 1, 2026, the bill eliminates the sales tax vendor fee that retailers are authorized to retain in connection with collecting and remitting state sales tax. The bill also makes conforming amendments to prevent additional sales tax revenue from being included in the calculation of state sales tax increment revenue for purposes of the "Colorado Regional Tourism Act" and to maintain the amount of sales and use tax revenue that the state treasurer annually credits to the housing development grant fund. Page 2, Line 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Page 2, Line 2SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration. (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that: Page 2, Line 3(a)Â Â The vendor fee in section 39-26-105, Colorado Revised Page 2, Line 4Statutes, was designed to reimburse retailers for a specific service Page 2, Line 5performed on behalf of the state: The collection and remittance of state-collected sales tax revenue; Page 2, Line 6(b)Â Â Not all retailers are equally compensated for their services. Page 2, Line 7Only retailers that have total taxable sales of $1 million or less for the Page 2, Line 8filing period are able to collect the vendor fee, and most of Colorado's Page 2, Line 9home rule cities do not pay similar vendor fees for the collection and Page 2, Line 10remittance of local sales tax. In addition, not all state taxes have vendor fees. Page 2, Line 11(c)Â Â The vendor fee is being removed to promote fairness and Page 2, Line 12equality between all retailers by ending this benefit that some retailers Page 2, Line 13receive and others do not receive. Further, the vendor fee is being Page 2, Line 14removed to simplify the collection of state-collected sales tax, ease Page 2, Line 15administrative burden, and relieve retailer confusion. Any revenue gain Page 2, Line 16caused by the removal of the vendor fee is incidental to the primary Page 2, Line 17purposes of promoting fairness and equality, simplifying the collection of Page 3, Line 1state-collected sales tax, easing administrative burdens, and relieving retailer confusion. Page 3, Line 2(d)Â Â Any revenue gain caused by the removal of the vendor fee is de minimis.
