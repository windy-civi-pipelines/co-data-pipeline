To determine whether the Governor has signed the bill or taken other action on it, please consult the legislative status sheet, the legislative history, or the Session Laws.</b></span></div>
<div class="WPParaBoxWrapper"></div>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>BY REPRESENTATIVE(S) Woodrow and McCormick, Bacon, Brown, Camacho, Froelich, Garcia, Lindsay, Mabrey, Sirota, Smith, Story, Willford, Zokaie;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>also SENATOR(S) Kipp and WinterÂ F., Cutter, GonzalesÂ J., MichaelsonÂ Jenet, Sullivan, Weissman, Coleman.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><ins class="uppercase">Concerning the elimination of the sales tax vendor fee that retailers are authorized to retain in connection with collecting and remitting state sales tax, and, in connection therewith, making an appropriation.</ins></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><i>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:</i></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><b>SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration.</b> (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that:</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(a)Â Â The vendor fee in section 39-26-105, Colorado Revised Statutes, was designed to reimburse retailers for a specific service performed on behalf of the state: The collection and remittance of state-collected sales tax revenue;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(b)Â Â Not all retailers are equally compensated for their services. Only retailers that have total taxable sales of $1 million or less for the filing period are able to collect the vendor fee, and most of Colorado's home rule cities do not pay similar vendor fees for the collection and remittance of local sales tax. In addition, not all state taxes have vendor fees.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(c)Â Â The vendor fee is being removed to promote fairness and equality between all retailers by ending this benefit that some retailers receive and others do not receive. Further, the vendor fee is being removed to simplify the collection of state-collected sales tax, ease administrative burden, and relieve retailer confusion. Any revenue gain caused by the removal of the vendor fee is incidental to the primary purposes of promoting fairness and equality, simplifying the collection of state-collected sales tax, easing administrative burdens, and relieving retailer confusion.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(d)Â Â Any revenue gain caused by the removal of the vendor fee is de minimis.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(2)Â Â The general assembly further finds and declares that:</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(a)Â Â Removal of the vendor fee is not a tax policy change for purposes of section 20 (4)(a) of article X of the Colorado constitution because it does not in any way affect the amount of sales tax imposed on and paid by taxpayers but instead only distributes a small portion of gross sales tax revenue collected to vendors for their collection and remittance of state-collected sales tax revenue;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(b)Â Â Further, even if removal of the vendor fee could be considered a tax policy change, consistent with the Colorado Supreme Court's holding in <i>TABOR Found. v. Reg'l Transp. Dist.,</i> 2018 CO 29, that legislation that causes only an incidental and de minimis tax revenue increase does not amount to a new tax or a tax policy change that requires advance voter approval under section 20 of article X of the Colorado constitution, the removal of the vendor fee is neither a new tax nor a tax policy change that requires voter approval; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(c)Â Â The removal of the vendor fee does not create new responsibilities or burdens on retailers. Instead, the removal of the fee demonstrates the general assembly's intent that the collection of sales tax revenue be fair and equal throughout the state, and that the burdens of doing so are limited, fair, and equal throughout the state.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><b>SECTIONÂ 2.</b>Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, 39-26-105, <b>amend</b> (1)(c), (1)(d)(I), and (5)(c); and <b>add</b> (1)(d)(V) as follows:</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><b>39-26-105.Â Â Vendor liable for tax - definitions - repeal.</b> (1)Â (c)Â (I)Â Â Every retailer shall remit, along with the return required in subsection (1)(b) of this section, an amount equivalent to the percentage on sales as specified in subsection (1)(a)(I) of this section to the executive director of the department of revenue, less an amount as set forth in subsection <del>(1)(c)(II) or</del> (1)(d) of this section to cover the retailer's expense in the collection and remittance of said tax.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(II)Â Â <del>For sales made prior to January 1, 2020, the amount retained by a retailer to cover the retailer's expense in collecting and remitting tax pursuant to this section is three and one-third percent of all sales tax reported.</del></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(III)Â Â If any retailer is delinquent in remitting said tax, other than in unusual circumstances shown to the satisfaction of the executive director of the department of revenue, the retailer shall not be allowed to retain any amounts under <del>this subsection (1)(c) or</del> subsection (1)(d) of this section to cover such retailer's expense in collecting and remitting said tax, and an amount equivalent to the said percentage, plus the amount of any local vendor expense that may be allowed by the local government to the vendor, shall be remitted to the executive director by any such delinquent vendor. Any local vendor expense remitted to the executive director shall be deposited to the state general fund.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(d)Â (I)Â (A)Â Â For sales made on or after January 1, 2020, <del>except as provided in subsection (1)(d)(I)(B) of this section</del><ins class="uppercase">but before January 1, 2026,</ins> the amount retained by a retailer to cover the retailer's expense in collecting and remitting tax in accordance with this section is four percent of the tax reported; except that a retailer shall not retain more than one thousand dollars in any filing period.</span></p>

This subsection (1)(d)(I)(B) is repealed, effective January 1, 2032.</del></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(V)Â Â <ins class="uppercase">Beginning January 1, 2026, a retailer is not permitted to retain any money to cover the retailer's expenses in collecting and remitting state tax in accordance with this section regardless of the retailer's total taxable sales for any filing period.</ins></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(5)Â (c)Â Â From the amount of the tax required to be remitted pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section, a qualified purchaser shall be entitled to retain the amount specified in subsection <del>(1)(c)(II) or</del> (1)(d) of this section that a retailer would otherwise be entitled to retain to cover the retailer's expense in collecting and remitting the tax imposed by this article 26 if the qualified purchaser had not provided a direct payment permit number to the retailer.</span></p>
