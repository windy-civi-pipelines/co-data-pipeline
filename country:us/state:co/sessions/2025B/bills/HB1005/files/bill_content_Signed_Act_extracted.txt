CONCERNING THE ELIMINATION OF THE SALES TAX VENDOR FEE THAT
RETAILERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO RETAIN IN CONNECTION WITH
COLLECTING AND REMITTING STATE SALES TAX, AND, IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH, MAKING AN APPROPRIATION.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:

Section 2:
SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
finds and declares that:
(a) The vendor fee in section 39-26-105, Colorado Revised Statutes,
was designed to reimburse retailers for a specific service performed on
behalf of the state: The collection and remittance of state-collected sales tax
revenue;
(b) Not all retailers are equally compensated for their services. Only
Capital letters or bold & italic numbers indicate new material added to existing law; dashes
through words or numbers indicate deletions from existing law and such material is not part of
the act.
retailers that have total taxable sales of $1 million or less for the filing
period are able to collect the vendor fee, and most of Colorado's home rule
cities do not pay similar vendor fees for the collection and remittance of
local sales tax. In addition, not all state taxes have vendor fees.
( c) The vendor fee is being removed to promote fairness and
equality between all retailers by ending this benefit that some retailers
receive and others do not receive. Further, the vendor fee is being removed
to simplify the collection of state-collected sales tax, ease administrative
burden, and relieve retailer confusion. Any revenue gain caused by the
removal of the vendor fee is incidental to the primary purposes of
promoting fairness and equality, simplifying the collection ofs tate-collected
sales tax, easing administrative burdens, and relieving retailer confusion.
( d) Any revenue gain caused by the removal of the vendor fee is de
mm1m1s.
(2) The general assembly further finds and declares that:
(a) Removal of the vendor fee is not a tax policy change for
purposes of section 20 (4)(a) of article X of the Colorado constitution
because it does not in any way affect the amount of sales tax imposed on
and paid by taxpayers but instead only distributes a small portion of gross
sales tax revenue collected to vendors for their collection and remittance of
state-collected sales tax revenue;
(b) Further, even if removal of the vendor fee could be considered
a tax policy change, consistent with the Colorado Supreme Court's holding
in TABOR Found. v. Reg'! Transp. Dist., 2018 CO 29, that legislation that
causes only an incidental and de minimis tax revenue increase does not
amount to a new tax or a tax policy change that requires advance voter
approval under section 20 of article X of the Colorado constitution, the
removal of the vendor fee is neither a new tax nor a tax policy change that
requires voter approval; and
( c) The removal of the vendor fee does not create new
responsibilities or burdens on retailers. Instead, the removal of the fee
demonstrates the general assembly's intent that the collection of sales tax
revenue be fair and equal throughout the state, and that the burdens of doing
so are limited, fair, and equal throughout the state.
