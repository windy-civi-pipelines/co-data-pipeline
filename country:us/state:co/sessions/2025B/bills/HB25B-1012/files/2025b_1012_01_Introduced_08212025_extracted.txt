A BILL FOR AN ACT
101 CONCERNING PRESCRIPTION DRUG SOURCING PROVIDED PURSUANT TO
102 A HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN.
Bill Summary
(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does
not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill
passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that
applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at
http://leg.colorado.gov.)
The bill creates the "Prescription Drug Sourcing Transparency and
Integrity Act" to prohibit a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) or a
health-care consultant from knowingly making or disseminating false or
misleading statements or claims to an employer, health benefit plan
sponsor, or policyholder about the legality or safety of a lawful alternative
prescription drug sourcing program.
Shading denotes HOUSE amendment. Double underlining denotes SENATE amendment.
Capital letters or bold & italic numbers indicate new material to be added to existing law.
Dashes through the words or numbers indicate deletions from existing law.
Upon written request by a self-funded employer or health benefit
plan sponsor, a PBM or health-care consultant is required to provide
certain cost information for each prescription drug dispensed under the
health benefit plan.
A violation of either the prohibition or information-sharing
provisions of the bill is an unfair method of competition and unfair or
deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance (unfair act or
practice). In addition to imposing the existing penalties for engaging in
an unfair act or practice, the bill authorizes the commissioner of insurance
to impose additional penalties for a violation of the prohibition or
information-sharing provisions of the bill in an amount up to $5,000 for
a fourth or subsequent violation (additional penalties). Additional
penalties collected are credited to the health insurance affordability cash
fund to facilitate a reduction in insurance premium increases and to help
avoid health insurance coverage loss.
The prohibition and information-sharing provisions of the bill do
not restrict or limit the rights of a self-funded employer or health benefit
plan sponsor to purchase prescription drugs through and contract for a
lawful alternative prescription drug sourcing program. The bill also
recognizes that a pharmacy stewardship program is an effective
cost-containment tool and is authorized when implemented in compliance
with federal law and with the bill.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) Improving transparency and integrity in prescription drug
5 purchasing protects employers and health benefit plan sponsors, supports

8 (b) It is the policy of this state to permit pharmacy stewardship
9 programs and alternative prescription drug sourcing programs
10 implemented in compliance with federal law in order to reduce net plan
11 costs without disrupting patient care.

Bill Summary
(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does
not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill
passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that
applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at

The bill creates the "Prescription Drug Sourcing Transparency and
Integrity Act" to prohibit a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) or a
health-care consultant from knowingly making or disseminating false or
misleading statements or claims to an employer, health benefit plan
sponsor, or policyholder about the legality or safety of a lawful alternative
prescription drug sourcing program.

Upon written request by a self-funded employer or health benefit
plan sponsor, a PBM or health-care consultant is required to provide
certain cost information for each prescription drug dispensed under the
health benefit plan.
A violation of either the prohibition or information-sharing
provisions of the bill is an unfair method of competition and unfair or
deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance (unfair act or
