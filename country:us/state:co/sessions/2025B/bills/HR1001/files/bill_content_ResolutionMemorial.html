<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>HOUSE RESOLUTION 25B-1001</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>BY REPRESENTATIVE(S) Duran and Bacon, Bird, Boesenecker, Brown, Camacho, Carter, Clifford, English, Espenoza, Feret, Froelich, Garcia, Gilchrist, Hamrick, Jackson, Joseph, Lieder, Lindsay, Lindstedt, Lukens, Mabrey, Marshall, Martinez, Mauro, McCormick, Paschal, Phillips, Pugliese, Rutinel, Sirota, Smith, Stewart K., Story, Taggart, Titone, Velasco, Weinberg, Willford, Zokaie, McCluskie.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>CONCERNING THE CONDEMNATION OF THE CONDUCT OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE RYAN ARMAGOST.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>WHEREAS, On April 11, 2025, former Representative Ryan Armagost, then serving as Minority Whip and Chair of the House Workplace Harassment Committee, which is the body charged with investigating workplace harassment complaints, took a photograph of a colleague, without her knowledge, while she stood in the well of the House chamber to debate her bill, and former Representative Ryan Armagost immediately shared that photograph in a Republican caucus group chat with comments that were subsequently deleted, prompting degrading and sexualizing remarks from multiple legislators who compared their colleague to a prostitute and stripper, made jokes about the "oldest profession", and further mocked her appearance; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>WHEREAS, That photograph was subsequently disseminated on social media by anonymous accounts, accompanied by vulgar commentary, and comments on the social media posts quickly escalated into racist and misogynistic attacks, rape threats, and violent threats directed against the colleague and her young children; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>WHEREAS, Former Representative Ryan Armagost's conduct was a violation of the General Assembly's Workplace Expectations Policy, which applied to him as a member, a member who was a leader of his caucus and the Chair of the House Workplace Harassment Committee, a position charged with upholding the very standards of safety and respect that his actions undermined; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>WHEREAS, Former Representative Ryan Armagost announced his resignation on August 21, 2025, shortly after news of a resolution to censure him became public, and his resignation does not erase the harm caused; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>WHEREAS, The House of Representatives declares that former Representative Ryan Armagost behaved inappropriately and failed to uphold the honor, dignity, and respect of the House of Representatives, which reflects poorly upon the state of Colorado and its citizens; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>WHEREAS, The House of Representatives finds that such conduct can create an unsafe and hostile workplace and can have a chilling effect on women serving in elected office; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>WHEREAS, The House of Representatives finds that former Representative Ryan Armagost failed to uphold decorum of the House of Representatives, and his actions were unbecoming of a member of this body; now, therefore,</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><i>Be It Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-fifth General Assembly of the State of Colorado:</i></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(1)Â Â That the House of Representatives condemns the actions of former Representative Ryan Armagost as conduct incompatible with the dignity of this body; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(2)Â Â That the House of Representatives affirms its ongoing responsibility to provide a safe, respectful, and professional workplace for all members, staff, and visitors and declares that harassment and misogyny will never be tolerated in this body; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(3)Â Â That every member of the House of Representatives commits to treating colleagues with dignity and respect, ensuring that disagreements remain rooted in policy and debate rather than in personal attacks, harassment, or demeaning conduct.</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><i>Be It Further Resolved,</i> That the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives print this Resolution in its entirety in the House Journal.</span></p>
