order, suspend or discontinue the functions or services of state
government (discretionary spending reductions) when there are not
sufficient revenues available to carry on the functions of the state
government.
The bill relocates the provisions of law allowing the governor to
make discretionary spending reductions and requires the governor to
promptly notify the joint budget committee (JBC) of the executive order.
As soon as practicable after receiving the notification, the JBC shall hold
a meeting to discuss the governor's plans for discretionary spending
reductions. At the meeting, the governor or the office of state planning
and budgeting (OSPB), or both, shall present the executive order to the
JBC and the JBC may provide advice regarding discretionary spending
reductions.
Under existing law, the governor is required to formulate and
implement a plan to reduce general fund expenditures when the
governor's regular quarterly revenue estimate indicates that appropriations
from the general fund then in effect will result in either using more than
one-half of the required amount of general fund reserve (reserve) or the
balance of the reserve dropping to below $1 billion (required spending
reductions).
In addition to the regular quarterly revenue estimate trigger, the
bill adds as a required spending reduction trigger for the governor that an
updated regular quarterly revenue estimate indicates that the state needs
to use an amount of the reserve equal to the lesser of 2% of general fund
appropriations for the fiscal year or one-half of the required reserve, or
when the balance of the reserve drops to below $1 billion.
Under existing law, the governor promptly notifies the general
assembly of a required spending reduction plan. The bill requires the JBC
to hold a meeting as soon as practicable after receiving the notification.
At the meeting, the governor or OSPB, or both, shall present the plan to
the JBC and the JBC may provide advice regarding the plan.
