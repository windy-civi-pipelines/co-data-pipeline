The health insurance affordability enterprise (enterprise) is
required to allocate a portion of the enterprise's revenue for subsidies to
state-subsidized individual health coverage plans purchased by qualified
individuals. The bill narrows the current definition of "qualified
individual" by excluding individuals who do not have lawful immigration
status in the United States and individuals who are ineligible for certain

federal health benefits.
1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
2 SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
3 finds and declares that:
4 (a) Colorado is facing a declared fiscal emergency for the current
5 state fiscal year, with the office of state planning and budgeting
6 projecting a deficit of $783 million;
7 (b) The state's financial condition requires immediate and
8 responsible action to preserve core services such as education, public
9 safety, transportation, and health care for documented Colorado citizens;
10 (c) In times of fiscal crisis, it is necessary and prudent to prioritize
11 the needs of Colorado citizens and lawfully present residents first,
12 ensuring that scarce state resources are directed to those who are eligible
13 for federal cost sharing or otherwise entitled to benefits under state and
14 federal law;
15 (d) Current statutes governing the health insurance affordability
16 enterprise and certain state-only, medicaid-equivalent benefits extend
17 subsidized health coverage to individuals who are not lawfully present in
18 the United States, including those who are ineligible for federal medicaid
19 benefits and federal premium tax credits;
20 (e) Continuing to provide such subsidies during a budget shortfall
21 not only diverts tens of millions of dollars annually from legal residents
22 but also risks policy conflicts that could further endanger federal grant
23 revenues upon which the state relies for essential programs;
24 (f) Clarifying statutory eligibility to exclude individuals who are
25 not lawfully present in the United States will free up significant health
-2- HB25B-1013
1 insurance affordability cash fund and general fund dollars, which can then
2 be directed to:
3 (I) Reduce or prevent premium increases for eligible Coloradans
4 in the individual health insurance market;
5 (II) Maintain coverage for lawfully present residents who are at
6 risk of losing insurance due to 2026 rate increases; and
7 (III) Preserve core state services threatened by the current fiscal
8 shortfall; and
9 (g) Section III.B.2. of executive order D 2025 009 calls for
10 "adjustments to the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise (HIAE) to
11 facilitate a reduction in premium increases and avoid health insurance
12 coverage loss for those in the individual market and those unable to
13 purchase through Connect for Health Colorado", and the changes in this
14 act are directly responsive to this call by making targeted statutory
15 adjustments to health insurance affordability enterprise revenue
16 allocations and by ensuring that resources are focused on eligible
17 Coloradans in compliance with both the scope of the executive order
18 calling for an extraordinary session of the general assembly and the state's
19 fiscal priorities.
20 (2) The general assembly therefore declares that this act is
21 necessary to maintain fiscal stability, ensure fairness in the allocation of
22 scarce public resources, protect the state's federal funding streams, and
23 prioritize the needs of Colorado citizens and lawfully present residents
24 during an extraordinary budget crisis.
25 SECTION 2. Legislative intent. (1) It is the intent of the general
26 assembly that:
27 (a) All state-administered health coverage subsidy programs
-3- HB25B-1013
1 funded in whole or in part by the health insurance affordability enterprise,
2 including the SilverEnhanced savings program under OmniSalud, limit
3 eligibility to individuals who are lawfully present in the United States, as
4 defined by applicable immigration law and state law;
5 (b) All state-administered health coverage programs that are
6 designed to mirror medicaid benefits but are funded solely from
7 state-revenue sources, including coverage for children and pregnant
8 individuals not eligible for medicaid matching funds, limit eligibility to
9 individuals who meet federal medicaid eligibility requirements, unless
10 otherwise expressly authorized by federal law or federal regulations;
11 (c) The phrase "qualified individual", as used in sections
12 10-16-1203 and 10-16-1205, Colorado Revised Statutes, be interpreted
13 and applied to exclude individuals who are not lawfully present in the
14 United States and individuals who are ineligible for federal medicaid or
15 federal premium tax credits, regardless of prior program rules or
16 administrative practices;
17 (d) The savings realized from the exclusion of ineligible
18 individuals from programs funded by the health insurance affordability
19 enterprise and from state-only health coverage programs be prioritized
20 for:
21 (I) Stabilizing premiums and reducing coverage losses in the
22 individual market for individuals who are lawfully present in the United
23 States;
24 (II) Maintaining coverage for eligible Coloradans during the
25 projected premium increases for plan year 2026 and beyond; and
26 (III) Supporting other essential state services that are necessary to
27 protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people of Colorado;
-4- HB25B-1013

9 application processes, eligibility verification systems, program guidance,
10 and public communications; and
11 (g) Agencies implement these changes in a manner that minimizes
12 disruption for lawfully present enrollees and ensures that communications
13 regarding eligibility determinations are clear, accurate, and accessible to
14 affected individuals.
15 (2) It is further the intent of the general assembly that this act be
16 construed broadly to achieve the fiscal, coverage, and policy goals
17 described in the legislative declaration and that any ambiguity in
18 interpretation be resolved in favor of preserving state resources for
19 citizens and individuals who are lawfully present in the United States
20 during the current fiscal crisis.
21 SECTION 3. In Colorado Revised Statutes, 10-16-1203, amend
22 (12) as follows:
23 10-16-1203. Definitions. As used in this part 12, unless the
