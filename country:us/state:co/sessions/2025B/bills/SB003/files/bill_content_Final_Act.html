<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><ins class="uppercase">Concerning supporting access to healthy food for Coloradans, and, in connection therewith, amending the ballot issue language for a measure on the November 2025 ballot and modifying the permissible uses of the healthy school meals for all cash fund.</ins></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><i>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:</i></span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><b>SECTIONÂ 1.Â Â Legislative declaration.</b> (1)Â Â The general assembly finds and declares that:</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(a)Â Â In July 2025, the United States Congress passed, and the president signed into law, a federal budget bill, Pub.L. 119-21, that significantly reduced funding for the supplemental nutritional assistance program and shifted new and ongoing financial responsibilities to the states;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(b)Â Â These federal changes are projected to, starting in state fiscal year 2026-27, impose at least $50 million in new annual costs to the state of Colorado to administer the supplemental nutritional assistance program and, in future years, potentially impose additional costs to the state of Colorado to provide a portion of the supplemental nutritional assistance program benefits;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(c)Â Â The federal budget bill also reduced funding for community-based outreach and application assistance in connection with the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which play a critical role in helping Coloradans access and retain program benefits;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(d)Â Â  Outreach for the supplemental nutritional assistance program promotes both equitable access and efficient, accurate administration of the program, helping prevent avoidable payment errors while maintaining access for all eligible people;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(e)Â Â The federal budget bill also eliminated the nation's only dedicated nutrition education program for households that benefit from the supplemental nutritional assistance program, ending over $6 million in funding for Colorado and eliminating access to programs that are vital for improving food security, dietary quality, and the ability to stretch limited food budgets for 325,000 Coloradans including 30,000 families;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(f)Â Â The United States department of agriculture's data shows that for every dollar spent on nutrition education, up to $10.64 is saved in health-care spending;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(g)Â Â The supplemental nutritional assistance program education directly reduces risk factors for conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity-chronic diseases that account for the bulk of health-care costs;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(h)Â Â Nutrition education is even more critical when families face steeper food prices and changes to the supplemental nutritional assistance program structure and eligibility that result in families needing support in doing more with less;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(i)Â Â Without investments in these programs, the hundreds of thousands of Coloradans-including children, families, older adults, veterans, and workers-who are eligible to receive supplemental nutritional assistance program benefits are at risk of losing vital food assistance and more Coloradans will go hungry;</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(j)Â Â House Bill 25-1274 directed the secretary of state to submit Proposition MM to the registered voters of the state to raise additional revenue for the full implementation of the healthy school meals for all program and its components, since the revenue raised in connection with Proposition FF was insufficient to fund the full implementation of the healthy school meals for all program and its components; and</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span>(k)Â Â  By modifying Proposition MM to support healthy food access for Colorado kids and families and to allow excess money collected beyond that necessary to fully fund and implement the healthy school meals for all program to be used to support filling the gap in funding for the supplemental nutritional assistance program caused by the reduced funding for the program as a result of the federal budget bill, voter approval of Proposition MM will ensure that all Coloradans have access to the nutritious food they need to thrive. </span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><b>SECTIONÂ 2.</b>Â Â In Colorado Revised Statutes, 22-82.9-213, <b>amend</b> (1) as follows:</span></p>
<p class="two-and-half-line-height"><span><b>22-82.9-213.Â Â Ballot issue related to Proposition FF revenue increase - repeal.</b> (1)Â Â At the statewide election held in November 2025, the secretary of state shall submit to the registered electors of the state for their approval or rejection the following ballot issue: "Shall state taxes be increased by $95 million annually by a change to the Colorado Revised Statutes <del>that, to support the healthy school meals for all program, increases</del><ins class="uppercase">to support access to healthy food for Colorado kids and families, including the healthy school meals for all program, and, in connection therewith, increasing</ins> state taxable income only for individuals who have a federal <del>tax</del><ins class="uppercase">taxable</ins> income of $300,000 or more by limiting itemized or standard state income tax deductions to $1,000 for single tax return filers and $2,000 for joint tax return filers for the purposes of fully funding the healthy school meals for all program to continue paying for public schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all public school students while also increasing wages for employees who prepare and serve school meals, helping schools use basic, nutritious ingredients, instead of processed products, and ensuring that Colorado grown and raised products are part of school meals; <ins class="uppercase">supporting the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that helps low-income Colorado families afford groceries; </ins>and <del>shall the state be allowed</del><ins class="uppercase">allowing the state</ins> to retain and spend as a voter-approved revenue change all additional tax revenue generated by these tax deduction changes?"</span></p>
